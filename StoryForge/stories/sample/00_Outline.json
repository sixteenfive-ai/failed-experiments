She arranges a meeting with Alli under the pretense of offering her services. The two meet in a neutral location, and Bettina presents the evidence. Alli, known for her intimidating presence, is initially furious but maintains her composure. She neither confirms nor denies the message but instead proposes a deal: Bettina will investigate the source of the message, and in return, Alli will ensure Bettina's silence and provide her with a substantial reward. Bettina, realizing the potential danger of crossing Alli, agrees, seeing it as a more profitable and less risky option. Alli brings in Tawnya to investigate the source.
