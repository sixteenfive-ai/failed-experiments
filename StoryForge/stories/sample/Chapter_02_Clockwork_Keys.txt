Bettina’s breath frosted in the evening air as she hurried down the narrow, cobbled street, the paladin shield heavy against her side. She’d chosen a longer route, deliberately avoiding the main thoroughfare where gossiping merchants and watchful guards might linger. Martie's request – no daggers – still felt odd, but Bettina wasn’t about to jeopardize this opportunity by questioning it.

Martie’s workshop was tucked away behind a bakery, the scent of rising bread a stark contrast to the metallic tang that clung to the air around the forger's establishment. A single, flickering gas lamp illuminated the entrance, casting long, dancing shadows.

Bettina pushed open the creaking door, a chime of tinkling metal announcing her arrival. Martie, sleeves rolled up and smudges of grime on her cheek, was indeed still tidying up. Gears and springs lay scattered across a workbench, reflecting the lamplight in a chaotic constellation. The air buzzed with the faint hum of tiny clockwork mechanisms, a sound Bettina was quickly learning to associate with Martie.

Martie looked up, her eyes sharp and assessing. "You brought it, I see. Good." She gestured towards another workbench, cleared, but still bearing the ghostly outlines of past projects. "Set it down there."

Bettina carefully placed the shield on the designated surface, the heavy *thunk* echoing in the relatively small space. The gryphon emblem, normally gleaming, looked dull under the gaslight. She watched as Martie circled it, hands clasped behind her back, like a predator sizing up its prey.

“Intricate work,” Martie murmured, more to herself than Bettina. “Typical paladin craftsmanship. They favor sturdy over subtle, but this… this has a certain… *flair*.”

She gestured towards a rickety stool tucked into a corner. “Have a seat. I’ll put the kettle on.”

Bettina sank onto the stool, the uneven legs wobbling precariously. The tea, when it arrived, was weak and lukewarm, poured from a chipped ceramic pot. Bettina barely tasted it. She needed answers, not herbal remedies.

“So,” she began, trying to keep the impatience from her voice. “You’ll be able to… decipher it?”

Martie didn’t answer immediately. She was already examining the shield, her fingers tracing the lines of the gryphon. She pulled out a magnifying glass, its brass frame gleaming in the light, and peered at the emblem with intense concentration.

“Decipher is a… strong word,” Martie finally said, still studying the shield. “Coded messages are my bread and butter, but this… this is no simple substitution cipher. The layers… they’re clockwork, I’d wager. Nested gears, intricate ratchets… someone went to considerable effort to conceal this.”

Bettina shifted on the wobbly stool. "So, you *can* do it, then?"

Martie finally looked up, a flicker of amusement in her eyes. “I wouldn’t have offered otherwise, would I? It will take time, Bettina. These things aren’t solved with a snap of the fingers. Think of it like disassembling a clock. You need to understand each piece, how it interacts with the others, before you can see the whole mechanism.”

She pulled a series of tools from a nearby drawer – tiny screwdrivers, delicate probes, and a set of clockmaker's lenses. The precision of the instruments was remarkable, a testament to Martie's skill. Bettina, however, was finding it difficult to remain still.

"While you’re doing that…" Bettina began, glancing around the cluttered workshop. “Mind if I… look around? Keep myself occupied?”

Martie shrugged, her attention already fixed on the shield. "Be my guest. Just don't touch anything you don't understand. And don't expect any interesting reading material."

Bettina rose from the stool, the wood protesting with a loud groan. She wandered through the workshop, her eyes scanning the various projects in different stages of completion. Half-finished automatons, intricate music boxes, and meticulously crafted lockpicks were scattered across the benches.

She stopped in front of a table littered with parchment scraps and ink bottles. On it lay a document, partially obscured by other papers, but bearing a familiar insignia – the crest of the Royal Merchant Guild. It appeared to be a replica, but an incredibly detailed one. The headings were visible: "Terms of Trade – Draconic Territories."

Her eyebrows furrowed. What would Martie be doing with a near-perfect copy of a trade agreement? And with Draconic territories, no less? The implications made her stomach clench. It was none of her business, of course. She was here for the code. Still, a sliver of an idea was growing like mold, promising riches beyond measure if Bettina played it right.

“So, Draconic territories, huh?” Bettina remarked casually, trying to sound merely curious as she eyed the document.

Martie didn't look up from the shield. “Commission,” she mumbled, her voice muffled by the clockmaker’s lens perched over her eye. “Merchant wanted a copy, better quality than the original. Claims his was damaged in a… goblin mishap.”

Bettina suppressed a snort. Goblins ate everything, so she assumed that a *goblin mishap* was probably just the noble not wanting to tell the full story. She sauntered closer, her gaze lingering on the half-finished replica. The detail was impressive. Truly. Martie’s talent was undeniable, and her clockwork skills were obvious in the meticulous nature of the craftwork.

"Impressive work," Bettina offered, then pivoted back to the central problem at hand. "Back to the *important* commission, any progress?"

Martie grunted noncommittally. "Patience, Bettina. I’m not conjuring rabbits out of a hat, you know. Each marking, the spacing and depth, it all seems intentional."

Bettina bit back another impatient retort. She paced, her boots clicking softly on the wooden floor. The scent of oil, metal, and ink filled the air, a strangely comforting blend despite the undercurrent of anxiety gnawing at her.

“What kind of incentive do you need?" Bettina prodded, glancing sideways. "For speed, I mean. A little extra motivation?”

Martie paused in her work, the tiny screwdriver hovering above the shield. She finally removed the lenses, turning to face Bettina with a raised eyebrow. “Are you offering me a bonus, *before* I’ve even deciphered the message? You must be more desperate than you let on.”

Bettina forced a smile. "Desperate? No. Optimistic? Absolutely. Think of it as an investment. The sooner we know what this message says, the sooner we can act on it."

"Act?" Martie echoed, a shrewd look in her eyes. "And what exactly do you plan to *do* with this information, Bettina?"

Bettina shrugged, feigning innocence. "That depends on what the message says, doesn't it? Maybe it's a shopping list. Maybe it's a declaration of war. You never know."

Martie snorted. "Right. A declaration of war hidden inside a paladin's shield with a gryphon emblem. Makes perfect sense.” She turned back to the shield, muttering under her breath. “Though, to be fair, things usually don’t make perfect sense.

Bettina watched her work for a moment, the tension building within her. She needed results. She needed them now. Every minute wasted was another minute for someone else to figure things out, to steal her opportunity.

“What if…,” Bettina began, choosing her words carefully, “what if this message implicated someone… influential? Someone who wouldn’t want their secrets exposed?”

Martie paused again, her eyes narrowed. "Are you suggesting blackmail, Bettina?"

Bettina’s eyes flicked back to the Draconic territories trade agreement lying forgotten on the bench. "Suggesting? No. Exploring possibilities? Absolutely."

Martie let out a low whistle. "You have a ruthless streak, don't you? I always knew you were ambitious, but I wasn't quite sure if you were cutthroat."

"Everyone has a price, Martie," Bettina said, her voice hardening. "The only question is whether you're willing to pay it." She watched Martie carefully for any sign of surprise or disgust. The less emotion the better.

Martie laughed softly, a dry, humorless sound. "Oh, I'm willing to pay it. Just not with my neck. And definitely not with my reputation." She gestured towards the replica, “that’s all you need. I can make or break the rich and the powerful. It is a burden, but one I do very well.”

“Good,” Bettina said, stepping back from the worktable. "Then we understand each other. Just… keep me updated. And maybe… maybe leave out some details when you share what you’ve found. I can draw my own conclusions.”

Martie picked up a new tool, a long thin probe ending in a tiny hook. She smiled, but it did not reach her eyes. “Consider it done, Bettina. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a clock to disassemble… metaphorically speaking, of course.”

Martie returned to the shield, her focus laser sharp, turning away from Bettina. “Clockwork," she repeated to herself, tracing one of the deeper engravings. "It’s always clockwork.”

She picked up the probe, the metal glinting in the lamplight. With deliberate movements, she began to work, the tip of the probe tracing the lines etched into the metal surrounding the gryphon. It looked as if the emblem was a puzzle; and that the probe was the key.

“So, tell me about this 'influential' person," Martie said, her voice casual. "What makes them so special? Dragons? Gods? Taxes?"

Bettina crossed her arms, leaning against a nearby shelf overflowing with springs, gears, and disassembled clockwork birds. "Let's just say they have…connections. Connections that could make a lot of people very uncomfortable if they were to…disappear."

Martie hummed, noncommittal. She carefully maneuvered the probe around the edge of the gryphon’s wing, a faint *click* echoing in the silence. "And what do you intend to do with this discomfort? Spread it around like jam on toast?"

"I intend to use it to my advantage," Bettina replied, her tone clipped. "Is that a problem?"

Martie paused, examining the spot where the probe had clicked. A tiny section of the shield seemed to have shifted. “It becomes a problem the moment my name is attached to it.” She didn't need this; she was comfortable in her own gray morality. Her forgeries provided comfort, and her customers kept her fed. Bettina threatened that peace; and she didn't like it.

“It won’t be,” Bettina countered. "You decipher the message. I handle the…delivery."

Martie snorted, a puff of air that ruffled a stray strand of hair. "Oh, I doubt that *very* much." Her mind was already racing, calculating the angles, anticipating the potential fallout. Bettina was like a storm; chaotic and destructive, drawn to power, but inevitably self-destructive. This job needed to be done and finished fast; before that mess swept into her workshop and drowned her.

She resumed her work, pressing the probe against another section of the shield. A soft grating sound filled the air as a hidden panel slid open, revealing a series of tiny gears, interlocking and spinning with surprising precision.

"Fascinating," Martie murmured, reaching for her magnifying glass. The clockwork mechanism was far more intricate than she had initially suspected. The entire shield, she realized, was a meticulously crafted puzzle box, designed to protect its secret. A secret she was about to unravel.

"Clockwork encryption," Martie explained, more to herself than to Bettina. "Each gear controls a different layer of the cipher. The position of the gears, the sequence in which they turn…it all contributes to the final message."

Bettina shifted impatiently. "Can you crack it or not?"

"Patience, Bettina," Martie snapped, her eyes still glued to the mechanism. "These things take time. Besides, even if I decoded the whole thing in an instant, you wouldn't know what to do with it." Martie ran her finger along the device; "I doubt your swords are of much help to crack codes or unlock black market secrets". She picked up another tool, a slender brush with bristles finer than a spider's silk.

"I can get you any tool you need," Bettina offered, her voice tight. "Just name it."

Martie glanced up, a flicker of amusement in her eyes. "Oh, I have everything I need, Bettina. What about you? Are you certain you have all you need to weather the coming storm?"

Bettina’s expression hardened. "I'm always prepared."

Martie doubted it, but didn't bother saying so. She dipped the brush in a small pot of etching solution and carefully applied it to the surface of one of the gears. The metal hissed softly, revealing a series of tiny symbols etched into its surface.

"There it is," Martie breathed, her voice barely a whisper. "The language of the gears."

She meticulously copied the symbols onto a small piece of parchment, her movements precise and deliberate. With each symbol deciphered, the pieces of the puzzle began to fall into place. The clockwork was whispering secrets, and Martie was listening intently. The secrets it held would spell change. It would decide whether her peaceful existence would be shaken by disaster and danger, or whether this was simply another contract.

Bettina, meanwhile, found herself increasingly irritated by the meticulous process. Martie hunched over the shield, a tiny gnome absorbed in a world of gears and symbols, muttering to herself in a language Bettina couldn't understand. The quiet scraping of metal against metal, the soft hiss of the etching solution, the concentrated furrow of Martie's brow—it all amplified Bettina's growing impatience.

She began to pace the cramped workshop, her boots clicking softly against the packed earth floor. The air hung thick with the scent of oil, metal shavings, and something vaguely floral that Bettina couldn’t quite place. The room was a chaotic testament to Martie's craft: shelves overflowing with tools, half-finished projects scattered across workbenches, and clockwork contraptions whirring and ticking in every corner.

A glint of polished wood caught her eye. On a nearby table, amidst a jumble of gears and springs, lay a meticulously crafted replica of a document, its edges worn to resemble age. Bettina picked it up, her eyes scanning the elegant script and intricate seals. It was some kind of trade agreement, the official stamp of the Human Merchant Consortium prominent at the top. But what drew her attention was the emblem alongside it: a stylized dragon, its scales gleaming.

Draconic territories. This was no ordinary forgery. This was something far more lucrative.

“Intricate piece, isn't it?” Martie’s voice startled Bettina, who quickly placed the document back on the table. The forger hadn't even looked up from her work, her attention still fixated on the shield's mechanism. “A noble wanted to renegotiate terms with a Dragon Lord. All he needs is evidence the council is not united.”

“Is it… difficult to forge official documents of this nature?” Bettina asked, trying to sound nonchalant.

Martie finally glanced up, a knowing smirk playing on her lips. "Difficult? Certainly. Impossible? Not for me. The trick is in the paper, the ink, and replicating the…personality, shall we say, of the official who signed it." She tapped the side of her nose. "And, of course, knowing what to leave out."

Bettina frowned. "Leave out?"

"Oh yes," Martie said, returning to the shield. "The absence of something can be just as convincing as its presence."

Bettina filed that away for later. The replica was a golden opportunity. If Martie could forge documents like this, what else could she do? And how could Bettina exploit that talent for her own gain? She could take this evidence and sell it to another Noble, perhaps even the Draconic Lord's own representative, for double the pay! She almost missed what Martie mumbled next.

"Got it!" Martie exclaimed suddenly, snapping Bettina back to the present. She leaned back, wiping a smudge of grime from her cheek with the back of her hand. "I've cracked the code. Give me a moment to piece it together."

Martie transcribed the decoded symbols onto a fresh piece of parchment, her pen flying across the surface. Lines of text emerged, revealing a message written in Common, but laden with archaic phrasing and subtle implications. As she read, Martie's brow furrowed, her expression darkening.

"This is… problematic," she muttered, pushing the parchment across the table towards Bettina. "Take a look."

Bettina leaned over the table, her eyes scanning the text. It took her a moment to decipher the convoluted language, but as the meaning became clear, a slow smile spread across her face.

"Alli Celio," Bettina breathed, reading the name aloud. "I've heard of her. Dragon-blooded merchant; moves between worlds."

"Precisely," Martie said grimly. "And according to this message, she's been manipulating trade routes, siphoning off resources for her own benefit, and funneling it into weapons. Enough to fund a medium-sized army."

Bettina's smile widened. "Destabilizing the peace between humans and dragons? That's… ambitious."

"And dangerous," Martie added sharply. "If this gets out, it could trigger a war."

Bettina considered the implications, but her mind was already racing with possibilities. Alli Celio, a powerful dragon-blooded merchant caught in a web of her own making. The opportunity was too good to ignore.

"So, what do you think, Martie?" Bettina asked, her voice laced with anticipation. "Should we expose her?"

Martie hesitated, her gaze fixed on the parchment. "This isn't a game, Bettina. We're playing with fire."

"But fire can be controlled," Bettina countered, her eyes gleaming with avarice. "And sometimes, it's necessary to burn down the old to make way for the new." She leaned closer, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Imagine the possibilities, Martie. We could leverage this. Blackmail Alli Celio. Dictate our own terms. We could have everything we ever wanted."

Martie stared at her, a mixture of fear and fascination in her eyes. She knew Bettina was dangerous, a whirlwind of ambition and ruthlessness. But she also knew that Bettina was right. This was an opportunity, a chance to escape the humdrum existence of a forger and step into a world of power and influence. But she was a simple artist, not a spy or an assassin. This could kill her.

She glanced back at the clockwork shield, its gears still whirring softly. A secret weapon, she thought grimly, in a game they were only just beginning to understand.

“What do you have in mind?” Martie asked, her voice barely a whisper.

Bettina didn’t immediately reply, instead turning her attention back to the half-finished document on the workbench. It was a large, ornate thing, covered in seals and swirling script. Even incomplete, it radiated an air of officialdom, the kind that could make or break fortunes. She reached out and gently touched the raised insignia of the merchant consortium stamped into the parchment. A stylized kraken wrapped around a cog. She’d seen it before, usually adorning the cloaks of puffed-up merchants haggling over prices in the marketplace.

“This trade agreement,” she said, more to herself than Martie. “With the Draconic territories… involving rare earth… why does it all feel… off?”

Martie, perched on her stool, watched Bettina with narrowed eyes. “Off how?”

“I don’t know.” Bettina circled the workbench, her fingers tracing the edges of the document. "It's just… I heard rumblings and whispers in the taverns about how the price of rare earth has been steadily rising. Something about disruptions at the source. They say the Dragon Coast is prone to landslides."

“Landslides, eh?” Martie hummed, feigning ignorance. She knew very well about the ‘landslides’. Everyone in Porthaven knew, in the same way they knew the moon turned the tides. Nobody dared say it aloud. Such words could garner some… unwanted attention from certain fire-breathing authorities.

Bettina continued, her voice growing more animated. “But the price isn’t going up organically with a natural disaster. Not in a way that would double the price on a single shipment. Somebody's manipulating the supply.” She glanced back at Martie, a shrewd glint in her eyes. "Someone like Alli Celio."

Martie busied herself organizing the clockwork components on her desk, avoiding Bettina’s gaze. “Pure speculation. You can't condemn someone on the word of drunken tavern braggarts.”

"Maybe. But speculation that aligns perfectly with our blackmail." Bettina tapped a long, lacquered nail against the replica agreement. "Is this for the kraken cogs too?"

Martie shrugged. “A small contract. A local rep wanted a… historical reproduction."

Bettina laughed, a short, sharp sound. “Historical? Right. More like they needed to change a few dates to look good in front of the Dragon Lords."

Martie said nothing. There was a certain line she tried not to cross in her forgeries. Actual manipulation of documents was for proper criminals. But the pay was so good, and these merchants paid promptly with good coin... Still, she wasn't sure that she could trust the merchant consortiums involved. She'd read stories of them betraying other partners and forgers.

"Look, Bettina," she said, finally meeting her gaze. "Let's not get ahead of ourselves. We have a powerful woman using her knowledge of two societies for profit."

"Power." Bettina savored the word. She was far too familiar with the opposite. "It is always a useful resource for someone who wants something."

Martie fiddled with a small gear, the metal cool against her fingertips. "This information… it’s dangerous. Alli Celio wouldn’t hesitate to silence anyone who threatened her operation."

Bettina crossed her arms, leaning against the workbench. "Then we'll have to be very careful, won't we? The more I look at this trade deal, the more I think Alli Celio is manipulating both sides. The Dragon territories and the human consortium. And I bet those rare earth prices are lining her pockets very nicely.”

A flicker of excitement danced in Martie’s eyes, quickly masked by her usual cautious demeanor. “So, you’re thinking… we approach Alli Celio directly? With the decoded message and this half-finished document?"

"Not approach," Bettina corrected, a predatory smile spreading across her face. "More like… corner her. Let her know we know. And then… we negotiate."

Martie hesitated, the implications of Bettina's plan swirling in her mind. Blackmail was a risky game, especially when dragons were involved. But the potential reward… the chance to finally escape the limitations of her workshop, to wield real influence… it was almost too tempting to resist.

"And what if she refuses?" Martie asked, her voice barely a whisper. "What if she calls our bluff? What if… what if she tries to kill us?"

Bettina's smile widened, revealing a flash of teeth. "Then, my dear Martie, we'll just have to be ready for her, won't we? This little bird has some talons of her own."

Martie chewed on her lip, her gaze unfocused. “Celio diverts the current. The scales tip in shadow," she mumbled, tracing the clockwork gears etched into her workbench with a greasy fingertip. "It… it’s a clever bit of misdirection.”

Bettina raised an eyebrow. "Misdirection? What do you mean?"

“The wording,” Martie explained, finally looking up. "It sounds like some grand conspiracy, a prophecy almost. But the key is in the language, the metaphor. 'Current'… that's trade routes. 'Scales'… balance of power, economic leverage. And 'shadow'? Unreported deals. She's siphoning off profits, manipulating shipments."

"So, Alli Celio is diverting trade routes, upsetting the balance, and making a fortune doing it," Bettina summarized, her voice laced with satisfaction. "Just as I suspected."

Martie nodded, pushing a stray lock of auburn hair behind her ear. "And the fact that it's couched in such dramatic terms… it’s meant to intimidate anyone who might stumble upon it without understanding the underlying mechanics." She paused, a thoughtful expression crossing her face. "I've seen this kind of coded message before. Years ago, I was tangentially involved in a rather unsavory counterfeiting ring. They used similar linguistic tricks to mask their transactions."

Bettina leaned closer, her eyes gleaming with interest. "Counterfeiting, you say? Is there no end to your talents, Martie?"

Martie bristled slightly. "It was a long time ago. A means to an end. I learned a few things, that's all. And this code… it has the same hallmarks. Sophisticated enough to fool casual observation, but ultimately solvable with the right knowledge."

The memory, she didn't say, involved sleepless nights and near-constant paranoia. It ended with a swift, unceremonious exit from the city and a renewed commitment to…slightly less illegal endeavors.

"And this agreement here," Bettina said, tapping the half-finished replica again. "The kraken cogs. Are you sure it's just a 'historical reproduction'?"

Martie avoided her gaze, busying herself with cleaning a small screwdriver with a rag. "That's what the client claimed. A… nobleman with an interest in archaic engineering."

Bettina snorted. "Archaic engineering, my foot. He needed a paper trail to explain some discrepancies in his ledger. How much did he pay you for this 'reproduction,' Martie? Enough to risk the Dragon Lords’ wrath?"

Martie finally met Bettina’s gaze, her expression unreadable. “Enough to cover my bills. Besides, plausible deniability is key, right?” She forced a chuckle that didn't quite reach her eyes. "And let's not forget, it’s my risk, not yours."

"Until we decide to corner Alli, then we will share the burden of your choices." Bettina stated it like a fact, as if they were partners discussing a joint business, and not two strangers on the brink of extortion.

"Right," Martie said dryly. "Power, eh? It is never a useless resource for someone who wants something. Including not getting squashed."

She shuddered, imagining Alli Celio's reaction to their blackmail attempt. The dragon girl was known for her shrewdness, her ruthlessness. And the consortiums would not be innocent either.

"We need leverage beyond the code," Martie continued, her mind racing. "Something undeniable, something that proves Celio’s direct involvement. Something that the Dragon Lords or the human consortium cannot deny."

Bettina nodded slowly, her eyes narrowed in thought. "The agreement itself? We could expose the altered dates, demonstrate how Celio profited from the inflated prices?"

"It's too risky," Martie countered. "Too easily dismissed as a simple forgery, which, you know, it literally is. We need something more…" She trailed off, her gaze drifting around the workshop, landing on the unfinished music box.

"What about the music box?" Bettina asked, following her gaze. "Does it tie in to any of this?"

Martie shook her head. "No. A separate commission from another noblewoman. I will get her copy done on time."

"Hm." Bettina did not appear to believe Martie. "You know, all of this is reminding me that there were daggers hidden in the shield that you seemed not to remember."

Martie froze. Bettina did not let things go easily. "Fine, they were there, and I found them after I said I would let you look. But I swear, they are long gone."

"Good," Bettina said, her eyes narrowing further. "Let us move past it."

A tense silence settled over the workshop, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of Martie’s clockwork creations. Martie felt a bead of sweat trickle down her temple, acutely aware of the danger they were courting. But beneath the fear, a spark of something else flickered to life. A thrill. The prospect of wealth, of power… of finally escaping the confines of her small, cluttered workshop. She just had to outsmart a dragon to get it.

Bettina’s eyes widened at the revelation. She immediately grasped the implications of the message: Alli Celio was manipulating trade routes for her own benefit, potentially destabilizing the delicate peace between humans and dragons. A cruel smile played on her lips as she recognized the potential for personal gain.

"And this agreement here," Bettina said, tapping the half-finished replica again. "The kraken cogs. Are you sure it's just a 'historical reproduction'?"

Martie avoided her gaze, busying herself with cleaning a small screwdriver with a rag. "That's what the client claimed. A… nobleman with an interest in archaic engineering."

Bettina snorted. "Archaic engineering, my foot. He needed a paper trail to explain some discrepancies in his ledger. How much did he pay you for this 'reproduction,' Martie? Enough to risk the Dragon Lords’ wrath?"

Martie finally met Bettina’s gaze, her expression unreadable. “Enough to cover my bills. Besides, plausible deniability is key, right?” She forced a chuckle that didn't quite reach her eyes. "And let's not forget, it’s my risk, not yours."

"Until we decide to corner Alli, then we will share the burden of your choices." Bettina stated it like a fact, as if they were partners discussing a joint business, and not two strangers on the brink of extortion.

"Right," Martie said dryly. "Power, eh? It is never a useless resource for someone who wants something. Including not getting squashed."

She shuddered, imagining Alli Celio's reaction to their blackmail attempt. The dragon girl was known for her shrewdness, her ruthlessness. And the consortiums would not be innocent either.

"We need leverage beyond the code," Martie continued, her mind racing. "Something undeniable, something that proves Celio’s direct involvement. Something that the Dragon Lords or the human consortium cannot deny."

Bettina nodded slowly, her eyes narrowed in thought. "The agreement itself? We could expose the altered dates, demonstrate how Celio profited from the inflated prices?"

"It's too risky," Martie countered. "Too easily dismissed as a simple forgery, which, you know, it literally is. We need something more…" She trailed off, her gaze drifting around the workshop, landing on the unfinished music box.

"Hm." Bettina did not appear to believe Martie. "You know, all of this is reminding me that there were daggers hidden in the shield that you seemed not to remember."

Martie froze. Bettina did not let things go easily. "Fine, they were there, and I found them after I said I would let you look. But I swear, they are long gone." Gone to the seedy merchant from the docks. She had not had time to find a better fence.

"Good," Bettina said, her eyes narrowing further. "Let us move past it."

A tense silence settled over the workshop, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of Martie’s clockwork creations. Martie felt a bead of sweat trickle down her temple, acutely aware of the danger they were courting. But beneath the fear, a spark of something else flickered to life. A thrill. The prospect of wealth, of power… of finally escaping the confines of her small, cluttered workshop. She just had to outsmart a dragon to get it.

"So," Bettina finally said, breaking the silence, "what is our next move?"

Martie sighed, pushing aside her initial excitement. "First, we need information. More information. I need to know exactly what Alli Celio is doing, who she’s working with, and what her ultimate goal is."

"And how do you propose we get that?" Bettina asked, her arms crossed. "I doubt she'll just tell us."

"I have connections," Martie said, a sly grin spreading across her face. "Friends in low places. People who hear things, see things. I can put some feelers out. See what whispers are floating around about Celio."

"Whispers," Bettina repeated, skepticism lacing her voice. "Hardly concrete evidence. We need proof, Martie, not rumors."

"Rumors lead to proof, Bettina," Martie retorted. "Besides, what other options do we have? You can’t just waltz up to a dragon girl and demand she hand over her secrets."

Bettina didn't respond, her gaze fixed on the intricate gears and springs of a half-assembled automaton bird on Martie’s workbench. Martie followed her gaze.

"Don't even think about it," she said, her voice sharp. "My birds are not spies."

"I was just admiring your craftsmanship," Bettina said smoothly, though her tone lacked conviction.

Martie snorted. "Right. Just stick to blackmail, Bettina. Leave the espionage to me."

She turned back to the coded message, tracing the unfamiliar symbols with her finger. "In the meantime, I'll see if I can find any more hidden compartments in the shield. Maybe there's a ledger tucked away somewhere. I would bet on that rather than your "whispers."

Bettina shrugged. "Fine. But don't take too long, Martie. Time is of the essence. Every moment we waste is another moment Celio has to consolidate her power."

Martie nodded, her mind already racing, formulating plans. This was more than just blackmail now. This was a game of cat and mouse with a dragon, and Martie was determined to win. And maybe, just maybe, she could make enough coin to buy herself a bigger workshop. One with windows that didn't rattle in the wind. One with a real door, and not this sagging hunk of flaking cheap plank-wood.

"Maybe," Bettina added, her eyes gleaming with avarice, "maybe Celio is simply too short-sighted to realize her true potential." She walked over to the table where Martie had placed the decoded parchment, her fingers tracing the now-meaningful symbols. "Imagine the possibilities, Martie. We could control trade, dictate prices… become richer than we ever dreamed."

Martie's initial thrill began to sour, replaced by a prickle of unease. Bettina's ambition felt… boundless. She looked up from the blueprint. "I'm not so sure. Playing with dragons is one thing, but attempting a trade war between the dragon territories and the Consortiums? It's mad."

"Madness begets opportunity," Bettina countered, her voice dangerously soft. "And the rewards...oh, the rewards."

Martie's mind flashed back to a scene she'd witnessed years ago: a forger, foolish enough to try and cheat Alli Celio on a delivery of a 'Dragon Proofing Ink', his workshop engulfed in emerald flames, his screams swallowed by the roar of the inferno. It wasn't a clean death; Celio made him watch the fake gold melt first. She shivered. "She burned his shop down, Bettina. To the ground. Over a minor transgression."

"He cheated her, Martie," Bettina dismissed with a wave of her hand. "We would be offering her a deal. A partnership."

Martie doubted Celio would see it that way. "And what makes you think she'll agree? She has power. She has influence. What do we have, besides this… risky information?"

Bettina stopped pacing and turned to face Martie, a predatory glint in her eyes. "We have leverage, Martie. And leverage is more valuable than gold."

Martie rubbed her temples, trying to quell the headache that was beginning to brew. "Leverage that could get us both killed."

"Or," Bettina purred, ignoring Martie’s apprehension, "it could get us everything we ever wanted."

"Everything has a cost," Martie sighed. She crossed her arms and took a deep breath, "And the cost here may be our lives."

Martie walked over to her workbench, pushing aside scattered tools and partially finished clockwork gears, and snatched up a magnifying glass. "Enough talk," she mumbled. "Let's focus on what we know. And, just maybe, we should find something that is a little more…solid."

She turned back to the shield. Every inch of its surface was meticulously crafted, the gryphon emblem gleaning even in the dim light of the workshop.

"Are you just gonna look at it, or do something with it?" Bettina asked, impatience evident in her voice.

Martie ignored her, her eyes scanning the intricate details of the shield, her fingers running along its edges. "There's something about the design," she murmured to herself. "A slight asymmetry... almost imperceptible."

She grabbed a small screwdriver from her workbench, her movements precise and practiced. With gentle pressure, she began to probe the edges of the gryphon emblem, searching for a seam, a hidden release.

"Careful, Martie," Bettina warned, her voice laced with a hint of anxiety. "You don't want to damage it."

"Damage is how you find the secrets" Martie snapped back, and with a muffled click, a section of the emblem popped open, revealing a small cavity hidden beneath.

"What did you find?" Bettina asked, stepping closer, her eyes wide with anticipation.

Martie reached into the cavity and pulled out a small, tightly rolled piece of parchment. Her eyes darted from side to side before unrolling it. It was a list. A list of names, dates, and… quantities? Numbers were something, at least.

"What is it?" Bettina pressed, hovering over Martie's shoulder.

Martie scanned the list, her brows furrowed in concentration. "It looks like a ledger," she said finally. "A record of transactions. Dates and amounts for materials and favors."

As she delved deeper into the document, a name caught her eye: "Grimbold Stonehand."

Martie felt a chill run down her spine. Grimbold Stonehand was a known fence, notorious for dealing in stolen artifacts and illicit goods. His involvement suggested that Alli Celio's dealings were far more nefarious than simple trade manipulation. The "whispers" she had planned on gathering suddenly felt very far away.

She looked up at Bettina, her expression grim. "This isn't just about trade routes, Bettina. This is about something much bigger. And much more dangerous."

Martie placed the list onto the workbench, the faint light catching on the ink-stained surface. Grimbold Stonehand… the name reverberated in her mind, a discordant note in an already unsettling composition. "We need to be careful," she said, her voice low and serious. "This changes things."

Bettina, still buzzing with a mixture of excitement and apprehension, leaned closer, her gaze fixed on the parchment. "How so? A fence is just a fence, isn't it? So, we'll just expose his name along with Alli's? Sounds good to me"

Martie shook her head slowly. "Grimbold doesn't just move trinkets. He deals in things people want to disappear. Evidence. Relics. Sometimes, even… people." The unspoken word hung in the air, heavy with implications.

Bettina's initial bravado seemed to falter, replaced by a flicker of genuine concern. "Right…" she murmured, chewing on her lip. "So, Alli is not just a dragon playing the game. She is…"

"Playing with fire," Martie finished for her. "And we’re standing a little too close to the flames." Martie’s eyes drifted around the room, landing on her collection of clocks and gears. Clockwork. The meticulous process of crafting a machine. This whole situation was like an intricate clock. Many gears, each impacting the other, moving toward an end neither of them know for sure. The smallest grain of sand in the cog and the entire structure collapses.

"But the reward…" Bettina began, her voice regaining some of its earlier enthusiasm. "Think about it, Martie! We could expose Alli Celio, become heroes, and rewrite the whole dragon trade dynamic, which could lead to even bigger commissions in the future."

Martie sighed. Bettina's ambition was a force of nature, capable of both inspiring and overwhelming. "And if we fail?" she countered. "What then? We become footnotes in someone else's grand design. Or worse."

"We won't fail," Bettina declared, her eyes gleaming with determination. "We're smarter than they are. More resourceful. And we have something they don't: the element of surprise."

Martie studied Bettina's face, searching for any hint of doubt or uncertainty. She found none. "Alright," she said finally, "we play it your way. But we do it smart. No reckless moves. No unnecessary risks."

Bettina grinned, clapping Martie on the shoulder. "That's what I like to hear. So, what's our first move?"

Martie paused, considering their options. "We need more information. This ledger gives us a starting point, but it's not enough. We need to know exactly what Alli is planning and who else is involved."

"Okay, I'm ready to work. What do we do?" Bettina says excitedly.

Martie was already moving toward her workshop tables filled with clockwork components. "Tonight, we sleep. I need to work with a clear head, and I am sure you need some rest, too. We will start first thing in the morning. We'll need to find a pattern in these names and dates, see if there are any other common connections."

Martie paused, her gaze drifting towards the half-finished replica of the Draconic trade document. "And maybe," she added softly, "we'll take a closer look at those trade routes. See if we can find any discrepancies that might tie back to Alli."

Bettina nodded, her expression thoughtful. "I'll handle that. I have some… contacts in the merchant guilds who might be willing to share information."

"Be careful," Martie cautioned. "Loose lips sink ships. And in this case, they could sink us both."

Bettina raised an eyebrow. "Always, Martie. And for what it's worth… thank you."

Martie waved her hand dismissively. "Don't thank me yet. We haven't even started."

As Bettina settled down on a cot in the corner of the workshop, Martie turned back to the workbench, her mind already racing. Alli Celio, Grimbold Stonehand, manipulated trade routes… The pieces of the puzzle were scattered before her, like disassembled gears waiting to be reassembled.

Martie picked up the magnifying glass, her eyes scanning the list once more. This wasn't just about money or power anymore. This was about something far more complex. A game of shadows and deception, where the stakes were higher than either of them could have imagined.

She glanced at the clock on the wall, its hands ticking steadily onward. Time was running out. And they were about to step into a world of danger and intrigue, where one wrong move could cost them everything. Martie pulled a blanket around her shoulder and put out the lamp light leaving just the faint glow of the moon illuminating the workshop.

Sleep wouldn't come easy, Martie knew. The gears were turning and they were about to start grinding, it was all a matter of time.
