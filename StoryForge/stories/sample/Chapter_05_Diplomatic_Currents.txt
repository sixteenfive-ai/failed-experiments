Bettina adjusted the collar of her borrowed tax auditor's coat, the coarse wool scratching at her neck. Grimbold Stonehand's residence loomed before her – not a mere house, but a statement carved from granite and ambition. Gargoyles with snarling faces and gemstone eyes guarded the entrance, their shadows stretching long in the afternoon sun.

*Opulent bastard,* she thought, suppressing a grimace. *And likely swimming in secrets.*

Taking a deep breath, she approached the heavy oak doors, their surfaces intricately carved with scenes of dwarves mining, trading, and – oddly enough – bathing in what looked like molten gold.

A stern-faced dwarf in livery answered her knock, his gaze sweeping over her with undisguised suspicion. “State your business.”

“Bettina Vayne, with the Porthaven Revenue Authority,” she said, presenting the forged credentials Martie had crafted. She allowed a hint of weariness to creep into her voice, a subtle performance to suggest routine, not intrigue. “I’m here to conduct a routine audit of Master Stonehand’s recent spice trade deals.”

The dwarf’s eyes narrowed, but he stepped aside. “Very well. Master Stonehand is expecting you. This way.”

The interior of the residence was even more extravagant than the exterior promised. Chandeliers dripped with crystals, tapestries depicting ancient battles hung on the walls, and the air was thick with the scent of imported incense and something…metallic?

Bettina followed the servant through a series of hallways, mentally cataloging every detail. This was more than a home; it was a fortress, a symbol of Stonehand's power and influence. Each painting, each piece of furniture, seemed designed to intimidate and impress.

Finally, they arrived at a large, oak-paneled study. Grimbold Stonehand sat behind a massive desk made of polished obsidian, his hands steepled in front of him. He was a dwarf of considerable girth, his beard braided with gold rings, his face a roadmap of wrinkles etched by shrewd deals and ruthless ambition.

"Ms. Vayne," Stonehand said, his voice a low rumble. "I trust your journey was… satisfactory? Though unexpected."

Bettina forced a smile. "Perfectly satisfactory, Master Stonehand. And routine audits, as you know, are always unexpected.” She gestured to the bulging satchel she carried. “I trust you have the ledgers related to your spice trade deals readily available?"

Stonehand chuckled, a sound like rocks grinding together. "Of course, Ms. Vayne. Always prepared. Always transparent." He clapped his hands, and the servant immediately produced several thick volumes bound in leather.

Bettina accepted the ledgers and settled into a chair opposite Stonehand’s desk. She opened the first volume, feigning a careful perusal of the entries. She scanned invoices, dates, and quantities, making small notations in a separate ledger.

“Impressive figures, Master Stonehand. Quite impressive.” She paused, her eyes scanning the page. "I see a rather large shipment of saffron imported from the Dragon Coast, recently. Did that not used to be Vorlag Spice Imports?"

Stonehand steepled his hands again, a slight tic developing in his left eye. "Vorlag was... unable to fulfill his obligations. These deals with dragons require certain…" He trailed off, searching for the right word. "…understandings."

Bettina raised an eyebrow. "Understandings that Master Vorlag lacked, perhaps?" She flipped through a few more pages, her fingers brushing against the edge of a particularly worn ledger. "And these transactions with Faldren Vayne… rather substantial, aren’t they? What is your relationship with Faldren Vayne?"

Stonehand shifted uncomfortably in his seat. “Vayne is… a client. A business associate. We occasionally engage in mutual ventures.”

Bettina knew she was getting to him. The man's carefully constructed facade of cordiality was beginning to crack, revealing the nervous machinations beneath.

"‘Mutual ventures.’" she repeated, making sure to emphasize her air quotes. “Would those 'ventures' by any chance, involve…undermining the trade alliance negotiated by Alli Celio?"

Stonehand’s eyes hardened. "I am a merchant, Ms. Vayne. I follow the currents of trade. My loyalty lies with profit, not politics."

“And what if profit and politics become…intertwined?” Bettina leaned forward, her voice dropping to a near whisper. "What if someone were to suggest that your 'mutual ventures' with Faldren Vayne are part of a larger plot? A plot to destabilize Celio, replace her with someone…more amenable to human interests, and perhaps regain a few spice trade contracts lost to the dragons?”

Stonehand stood abruptly, his chair scraping against the obsidian floor. “That is a preposterous accusation! I demand you cease this line of questioning immediately. Show me your authorization!"

*Bingo,* thought Bettina, hiding a smirk. *Now we're playing in the good stuff.*

Bettina held up a hand, feigning innocence. “Of course, Master Stonehand. My apologies if my line of questioning became…strenuous. It is a long day filled with work. Please do forgive. May I use your lavatory?” She offered a disarming smile, the same one she used to fleece drunkards at dice games.

Stonehand hesitated, his eyes still narrowed. "The washroom? It’s…through that door, at the end of the hall." He pointed towards a dark oak door near the corner of the room. "Don't you have those strange Gray Scale bladder stone charms? I understood it's what the Order is using now."

Bettina waved a dismissive hand. “Oh, I simply prefer to empty myself manually, thank you! Much faster, I assure you.” She rose, clutching her stomach dramatically. “Too much tea. You know how it is."

Stonehand grunted, not entirely convinced, but relieved to have the conversation shift. “Be my guest.” He remained standing, watching her intently.

Bettina walked towards the door, giving him a polite nod. As she rounded the corner, out of his immediate line of sight, she subtly flicked her wrist. A barely perceptible shimmer of magic washed over the door leading to Stonehand’s study, picking the lock silently. Years of petty crime, of opening stubborn chests and locked coffers, had honed her skills to a razor's edge.

She continued down the hallway, past the washroom, and towards the study door. Confirming that Stonehand couldn’t see her from his position in the main room, she slipped inside.

The study was exactly what she expected – opulent and overbearing. Shelves overflowing with dusty tomes lined the walls, interspersed with grotesque statues of dwarven kings and scenes of battle. A heavy oak desk dominated the room, its surface littered with scrolls, quills, and wax seals.

Bettina moved quickly, her eyes darting from object to object. She ignored the books and the curiosities, focusing on the desk. The sooner she was out, the better. Rummaging through the papers, she found what she was looking for – a small stack of recent correspondence.

She quickly sifted through the letters. Most were mundane requests for shipments, reports on market conditions, and demands for payment. Then she found it. A coded message, nearly identical to the one she'd discovered within the paladin shield. The same complex cipher, the same distinct rhythm of symbols.

*Jackpot.*

She scanned the message, committing a few key phrases to memory. There was mention of a “sacrifice” to be made, a “delay” that was becoming problematic, and a “new puppet” being considered. It seemed the plot to destabilize Alli Celio was far more advanced, and widespread, than she initially suspected.

*Just who do they want to put on the throne,* she thought, already trying to puzzle who would follow the strings of Faldren Vayne. *Maybe he intends to put himself on the throne. If only I knew what the dragon had told Alli.*

Beneath the coded message, she found a more recent ledger. This one was less meticulously maintained than the ones Stonehand had presented her. It was filled with hastily scribbled notes, coded entries, and… a name. Not one, but many familiar ones. Vayne's name was listed again, along with multiple merchants. But there was a second list – a separate ledger listing names of politicians.

*These people have political weight.* She quickly scribbled the list in her own journal to return to later for Martie to analyze. She would need to be as fast as possible.

As she was about to leave, a small glimmer of metal caught her eye. Tucked away at the back of the drawer was a paladin shield, clearly fake given that the emblem was printed rather than pressed into the metal. On closer examination she noticed what appeared to be an engraving of a Gryphon similar to the shield she and Martie originally investigated. She touched it to try and remove the shield to get it examined when a floorboard behind her creaked loudly.

Bettina froze, her heart pounding in her chest. Had Stonehand heard her? Had she been in here too long?

She placed the shield and ledger back exactly as she found them and hurried to the door. Making sure the lock was properly set, she slipped back into the hallway, her breath catching in her throat. She adjusted her dress, smoothed her hair, and continued towards the washroom, forcing a casual swagger.

She spent a few moments washing her hands, splashing water on her face to cool her flushed cheeks. She took a deep breath, composing herself. Time to face the music.

She emerged from the hallway, back into Stonehand’s study. He was standing exactly where she had left him, his face a mask of suspicion.

“Everything alright, Ms. Vayne?” he asked, his voice tight. “You seemed to be gone for quite some time.”

Bettina forced a smile. “Perfectly fine, Mr. Stonehand. Just admiring your… extensive collection of maps.” She gestured vaguely towards a wall covered in charts. "I tend to get lost in these places. It happens more often than I care to admit."

Stonehand didn't look convinced. “Indeed. Well, shall we continue our discussion of the… proposed trade route adjustments?”

“Of course,” Bettina replied, attempting to appear unfazed. “Lead the way.”

As Stonehand led her back to his desk, Bettina subtly scanned the room, trying to discern if anything had been moved or disturbed. Nothing seemed out of place. But she couldn’t shake the feeling that she had been caught.

Back in the study, Stonehand picked up where they left off, outlining his proposed adjustments to the Draconic trade routes. Bettina listened attentively, occasionally interjecting with questions that allowed her to steer the conversation towards Faldren Vayne and his potential involvement in the conspiracy.

“Mr. Stonehand, I must admit, the more I learn about these trade routes, the more I am questioning your choice to work with Faldren Vayne," Bettina asked. “His… reputation precedes him, shall we say. I'm only pointing this out, because Celio seems to frown on human merchants that take from Draconic deals."

Stonehand stiffened slightly. “Faldren Vayne is a… valuable asset,” he said carefully. “He has extensive connections and a deep understanding of the local markets. His family is a fixture of Porthaven's trade.”

“Connections can be bought, Mr. Stonehand. And understanding can be feigned,” Bettina countered smoothly. “Especially when so much is at stake. Is it possible his dealings are against Celio?”

Stonehand chuckled humorlessly. “Faldren Vayne is fiercely loyal to the consortium. He would never do anything to jeopardize its interests, let alone Alli's." He seemed desperate to reassure her that Faldren was in control. "The Grey Scales would never hire him, were that the case."

Bettina filed away his response. Loyal, perhaps, but clearly ambitious, and possibly dangerous. She had her next target, and she could not waste any time getting there.

“I appreciate your candor, Mr. Stonehand,” she said. “However, I would still like to have a look at Vayne's own warehouses for the arrangement. Perhaps this evening.”

Stonehand hesitated. “I'm not sure that would be possible. Mr. Vayne is a very private man.”

“Then it's settled," Bettina grinned. "Tonight it is." She flashed a sly smile that sent chills down Stonehand's spine. "But on the other hand I appreciate you trusting me enough to be in control of the operation."

Later that evening, under the cloak of darkness, Bettina found herself standing across the street from a sprawling warehouse district on the outskirts of Porthaven. The air was thick with the smell of brine and unwashed humanity. This was Vayne's territory.

The warehouses were mostly dark, but she noticed movement in one of the larger buildings. A flickering lantern cast long, distorted shadows against the brick walls. *Bingo.*

She made her way carefully across the street, keeping to the shadows. As she drew closer, she could hear muffled voices coming from inside the warehouse. She pressed herself against the cold brick, straining to listen.

“…absolutely unacceptable!” a voice boomed, laced with anger and frustration. It was Vayne.

“… the Dragonborn are ruining us, I tell you! Ruining us!” He was definitely displeased by recent changes.

“What do you expect us to do about it, Faldren?” another voice whined. “Alli Celio has the entire High Council behind her. The Dragonborn have never had any power like this before!"

“We find a way,” Vayne snapped. “We always find a way.”

A chorus of murmurs rippled through the group. Bettina strained to make out more details about their faces and voices. These merchants were shadier than any of her contacts from home.

"You just say the word, Faldren, and we'll do whatever you need. You just need to give us the signal," said a hulking brute of a man. The accent sounded like he was from North of the Kingdom.

Vayne paused, his voice softening slightly. "I appreciate the sentiment. But we must be cautious. Alli Celio is not to be trifled with." He was trying to dissuade them while also inciting action. A dangerous strategy. "However, the situation is becoming increasingly dire. If we don't act soon, there may be nothing left to save."

"We're ready to get our hands dirty for this," another thug croaked. The whole group felt like a festering wound.

Bettina's mind raced. What were they planning? And how far were they willing to go? This was far more than just a disgruntled merchant complaining about lost profits. This was a conspiracy, plain and simple. She realized something from Celio's message she hadn't realized before. They were making her chase shadows, but Celio knew these men could do whatever needed to be done.

She edged closer, her hand instinctively reaching for the small dagger concealed beneath her cloak. Time to see just how deep this rabbit hole went.

Bettina slipped away from the warehouse, melting back into the Porthaven night. The damp air clung to her skin, and the weight of her discovery settled heavy in her stomach. This was far bigger than a few sour grapes and a bad trade deal. This was a full-blown conspiracy, aimed squarely at Alli Celio and, quite possibly, the fragile peace she represented.

The Whispering Coin Tavern, thankfully, was still open when she arrived. The familiar aroma of stale ale and singed bread filled the air, a comforting contrast to the chilling conversation she had just overheard. Martie was behind the bar, polishing glasses with a practiced hand, her brow furrowed in concentration.

Bettina slid onto a stool, catching Martie's eye. "We need to talk."

Martie raised an eyebrow, pouring her a mug of ale without asking. "That tone usually precedes trouble. What have you dug up this time?"

Bettina took a long drink, the bitter liquid doing little to quench the dryness in her throat. "Stonehand and Vayne...they're not just disgruntled merchants. They're plotting something big against Celio. A conspiracy."

Martie stopped polishing, her expression turning serious. "Elaborate."

Bettina recounted her eavesdropping, relaying Vayne's thinly veiled threats and the eager agreement of his cronies. She emphasized the sheer animosity directed at both Celio and the Dragonborn.

"So, they're looking to…remove Celio?" Martie asked, her voice low. "And likely install someone more amenable to their interests, someone who'll prioritize human merchants over Draconic trade agreements?"

"Exactly," Bettina confirmed. "It's not just about money; it's about power. They see Celio as a threat to their way of life."

Martie sighed, running a hand through her short, cropped hair. "This is worse than I thought. If a full-blown conspiracy is brewing, things could get very messy, very quickly. And we're right in the middle of it."

Bettina slammed her mug on the counter, frustration simmering beneath her skin. "Then we need to do something! We have leverage, Martie. We know what they're planning."

"And that makes us targets," Martie pointed out sharply. "Don't forget, these are powerful people with a lot to lose. They won't hesitate to silence anyone who gets in their way."

"I know the risks," Bettina snapped. "But we can't just stand by and watch them tear everything down. What about the money, the power?"

Martie’s gaze softened, recognizing Bettina's internal struggle. "We have to be careful, Bettina. This isn’t some simple blackmail scheme. We're playing with forces we don't fully understand. We need to gather more information, understand the scope of this conspiracy before we make a move."

Bettina slumped back on her stool, the weight of Martie's words settling on her. "So, what? We just sit here and wait?"

"Not exactly," Martie said, a hint of a mischievous glint returning to her eyes. "We use our assets. I can tap into my information network and see what I can dig up about Vayne's operation. But it will take time."

Bettina frowned. "Time we may not have." She paused, then leveled a pointed look at Martie. "And you never leave this tavern. Why is that? Are you afraid of getting your hands dirty?"

Martie's face tightened, a flash of hurt crossing her features. She opened her mouth to speak, then hesitated, glancing around the mostly empty tavern. Finally, she leaned closer, her voice barely a whisper. "It's…complicated. Let's just say I have responsibilities here."

"Responsibilities?" Bettina pressed, sensing a vulnerability she hadn't seen before. "What kind of responsibilities?"

Martie sighed, her shoulders slumping. "I'm… an information hub. For Celio."

Bettina stared at her, speechless. "You're…what? You work for Celio? But you…you forge documents! You're involved in all sorts of shady dealings!"

"It's not that simple," Martie said, her voice defensive. "I provide information, discreetly. I gather intelligence, pass it along. I don’t get involved in the… unsavory parts."

Bettina let out a short, bitter laugh. "Right. And I’m sure Celio’s hands are clean."

"Look, Bettina," Martie said, her voice pleading. "I can’t explain everything right now. Just trust me. I'm not just some back-alley forger. I have a role to play in all of this. And part of that role is keeping this tavern running. It's… a safe house. A meeting place. I can't just abandon it."

Bettina stared at her, absorbing this new information. Martie, an information hub for Alli Celio, bound to the Whispering Coin. It was a twist she hadn't seen coming.

"So, all this time, you’ve been playing both sides?" Bettina asked, a hint of accusation in her voice. "Helping me while also working for Celio?"

"No!" Martie insisted. "I'm helping *you* now. I can provide you the information for the end game. Celio needs to fall as much as those merchants do, to ensure stability. The High Council has been watching the whole time, after all."

"You're going to double cross both parties, using me to do it?" Bettina realized with her eyes wide.

Martie simply stared back at her, saying nothing.

Cristionna, seated at the head of the High Council's massive mahogany table, cleared her throat. The sound echoed through the otherwise silent chamber, causing the dozen or so merchant representatives to fidget nervously. Sunlight streamed through the arched windows, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air, doing little to warm the atmosphere.

“Good morning, gentlemen," Cristionna began, her voice calm but firm. "I’ve called you here today to discuss a matter of... mutual interest."

She scanned the room, her gaze lingering on each representative in turn. There was Faldren Vayne, of Vayne Trading, his face flushed with a barely-contained anger that Cristionna had hoped to see. Beside him sat Eldrin Greycloak, representing the Greycloak Cartel, his usual stoic expression unreadable. And across the table was Master Gulmick, the goblin representing the Stone Tooth Syndicate, his sharpened teeth an unnatural sight.

"As you know," she continued, "the High Council is deeply invested in the stability of Porthaven, and, indeed, the entire realm. That stability rests, in no small part, on the healthy flow of commerce."

A murmur of agreement rippled through the room. Cristionna held up a hand, silencing them.

"Recently, however, I’ve become aware of certain… concerns regarding that flow. Concerns that, if left unaddressed, could potentially disrupt the delicate balance we’ve worked so hard to maintain."

Faldren Vayne shifted in his seat. Cristionna fixed him with a piercing stare. "Specifically, I'm referring to the recent tensions surrounding Draconic trade agreements, and the perceived favoritism shown towards them.”

A tense silence followed. Eldrin Greycloak was the first to break it. "With all due respect, Councilor, these agreements are vital to our city's prosperity. Draconic goods are highly sought after, and the trade routes are, so far, secure.”

"Indeed," Gulmick piped in, his voice raspy. "The Stone Tooth Syndicate has benefited greatly from the increased traffic."

Cristionna raised an eyebrow. “And have these benefits extended to *all* members of the merchant consortiums?” She let the question hang in the air, watching as unease spread across their faces. "There have been… whispers," she continued, "of discontent. Of certain individuals feeling… overlooked. And then, of course, there are the recent allegations surrounding Alli Celio, of the Grey Scales, as it pertains to illicit use of funds."

Vayne slammed his fist on the table. "The Grey Scales, as usual, get away with bending the rules for their benefit, while those of us doing our jobs must watch idly by."

Cristionna allowed herself a small, almost imperceptible smile. “Is that so, Master Vayne? Tell me, in your own words, about your dealings with Celio in recent years.”

Vayne sputtered, caught off guard. “I… I fail to see how that’s relevant. Our dealings have been strictly professional.”

“Strictly?” Cristionna pressed, her voice like steel. “I assure you, Master Vayne, the High Council is keenly interested in *every* detail of those dealings. Every transaction, every agreement, every… disagreement."

She watched as Vayne struggled to regain his composure. The other merchants shifted uncomfortably, realizing they were witnessing something more than just a routine inquiry. They were witnessing a power play.

Cristionna pressed on, her gaze sweeping across the room. "The stability of Porthaven depends on transparency. It depends on cooperation. And it depends on… honesty. I trust that you gentlemen understand the importance of these virtues."

She leaned forward, her eyes gleaming with an intensity that made even the hardened merchants flinch. "Now, let us delve into the specifics, shall we? Let’s start with those Draconic spice imports. I believe Master Vorlag was the one initially passed over on that shipment."

With the mentioning of Vorlag, Vayne's eyes lit up in a strange manner that Cristionna picked up on, further strengthening the idea of a conspiracy.

As Vorlag began to explain the details of his failed spice exporting deal, Cristionna already knew that this would be a long process, one that would demand every ounce of her political skill and cunning. But the first few cracks were starting to show in their united front. The scales, indeed, were tipping. And with a little more pressure, Cristionna was confident she could unearth the truth, and protect both Porthaven and Alli Celio from whatever treacherous scheme these merchants had concocted. It was a messy, complicated game, but one Cristionna was prepared to play.

Cristionna waited until Vorlag finished recounting his version of events, pausing just long enough for Vayne to visibly bristle at what he considered to be blatant whining. Then, she requested a private word with Faldren Vayne in his office, his personal headquarters for the Consortium. The other merchants, relieved to be excused, hastily gathered their papers and mumbled their farewells, leaving Cristionna and Vayne alone.

The office was opulent, showcasing Vayne's success – or at least, his *apparent* success. Rich tapestries adorned the walls, depicting scenes of maritime trade, and a massive, intricately carved desk dominated the room. The air hung heavy with the scent of expensive cologne and, beneath that, something metallic and vaguely unpleasant.

Cristionna took a seat in one of the plush leather chairs, deliberately choosing one that positioned her to look up at Vayne, who remained standing behind his desk. The subtle power dynamic was not lost on either of them.

"Master Vayne," Cristionna began, her voice low and measured, "I'll be blunt. I know about the coded message. I know about your involvement. And I know about your...displeasure...with Alli Celio."

Vayne’s face hardened, but he maintained his composure. “Councilor, these are serious accusations. I am a respected member of the merchant community. I would never… conspire against the well-being of Porthaven.”

Cristionna smiled, a cold, mirthless expression. “Spare me the platitudes, Master Vayne. I’m not here to debate semantics. I'm here to deliver a message.”

She leaned forward, her eyes locking with his. “Alli Celio’s position within the Grey Scales is…integral to the stability of this city. To the alliance with the Dragonborn.”

Vayne scoffed. “The Dragonborn? Are you suggesting we bend to the whims of scaled beasts? They leech off our resources, demanding special treatment. The Grey Scales is merely a means to funnel resources to those creatures, that is why her influence cannot go unchecked!”

Cristionna ignored the outburst. "If anything were to happen to her...if she were to be harmed, destabilized, or...removed...the consequences would be catastrophic. The alliance would shatter. Trade would collapse. And Porthaven would be caught in the crossfire."

She paused, letting her words sink in. “Do you understand the magnitude of what you're playing with, Master Vayne? This isn’t just about lost spice deals or hurt pride. This is about the future of our city.”

Vayne crossed his arms, his face a mask of defiance. “I assure you, Councilor, I have no intention of harming Alli Celio. My concerns are purely professional. I simply believe her trade practices are… detrimental to the overall health of the Porthaven economy.”

Cristionna studied him, searching for any hint of sincerity. But all she saw was resentment, ambition, and a deep-seated sense of entitlement.

"Detrimental?" she repeated, her voice dripping with skepticism. "Or detrimental to *your* profit margins?"

She stood up, her gaze unwavering. "I am giving you a warning, Master Vayne. Tred carefully. The High Council, myself included, will be watching you very closely. Any attempt to undermine Alli Celio, any action that threatens the alliance with the Dragonborn, will be met with the full force of the law."

Cristionna paused at the door, turning back to face him. "And let me assure you, Master Vayne, the High Council's reach is longer, and its memory is sharper, than you might think."

She left him standing there, a statue of barely controlled rage. As she walked through the outer offices, she could feel the eyes of the Consortium members boring into her back. They knew something was up. They could sense the shift in the wind.

As she exited the Consortium Headquarters, Cristionna took a deep breath of fresh air, trying to clear her head. She had delivered her warning. Now, all she could do was wait. Wait and watch.

*He's lying,* she thought grimly. *I can feel it. But what is he truly planning? And who else is involved?*

The thought of Bettina flickered through her mind. *The scales are tipping*, she had sent her. She wondered how the information broker was handling the delicate situation. Cristionna needed more intel and the only thing she could do at this time was have faith that the woman would bring her what she needed to crush this brewing situation.

It was going to be a long and dangerous game. But Cristionna was determined to win. The fate of Porthaven, and perhaps the world, depended on it.

Cristionna found Alli precisely where she expected: pacing the length of the war room table, her brow furrowed in thought. Tawnya stood silently nearby, a comforting presence despite her imposing size. Maps of Porthaven and the surrounding territories were spread out before them, dotted with miniature figures representing troop movements and trade routes.

"Cristionna," Alli said, her voice tight with controlled frustration. "Tell me everything."

Cristionna laid out her encounter with Vayne, sparing no detail of the merchant's animosity and the subtle, yet unmistakable, threat she perceived.

"He claims his concerns are purely economic," she concluded, "but I don't believe him. He’s deeply resentful of you, Alli. And he's clearly involved in something far larger than a simple trade dispute."

Alli stopped pacing, her gaze fixed on a point somewhere beyond the maps. "Destabilization... He's not just targeting me, he's targeting the alliance itself."

Tawnya shifted slightly, her hand resting on the hilt of the massive greataxe strapped to her back. "The Dragonborn won’t take kindly to attempts to fracture our bond, Alli. Any attack against you will be seen as an act of war."

"Precisely," Alli agreed. "That's what makes this so dangerous. Vayne, or whoever is pulling his strings, is gambling with the future of Porthaven. He is making this personal and endangering the alliance."

A silence fell over the room, heavy with unspoken concerns. Cristionna could see the weight of responsibility etched on Alli's face.

"We need to know who else is involved," Alli said finally, her voice regaining its steel. "Vayne isn’t smart enough to orchestrate something like this on his own. He’s a pawn." She finally looked at Tawnya, a sense of command filling her face. "Tawnya, I need you to focus on the consortiums. Monitor their movements, their communications, everything. I know the Grey Scales are spread thin, but this takes precedence."

"It will be done, Alli," Tawnya replied, her voice a low rumble.

"And…keep an eye on Cristionna as well,” Alli added, a flicker of concern crossing her face. “If they suspect she is involved, they won’t hesitate to make a move against her. They will be careful.”

Cristionna inclined her head. "I appreciate the concern, but I can handle myself. However, I do suggest that you find out the extent of my exposure. My visit tonight will surely set tongues wagging."

Alli nodded. "That is what I want to ask you next."

She turned to Alli, her expression hardening. "I intend to launch a formal investigation. We need to find out who leaked that coded message, who’s backing Vayne, and what their ultimate goal is." She paused. "And discreetly. We can’t afford to cause a panic, especially not with the Dragonborn delegation due to arrive next month.”

Tawnya suggested. “I have a few contacts within the city. People who hear things. Whispers in the taverns, rumors in the markets.”

"Informants?" Alli raised an eyebrow.

"They have proven reliable in the past," Tawnya confirmed. "They could provide us with valuable intelligence."

Alli considered this, her fingers drumming against the table. "Very well. Use them. But be careful, Tawnya. The consortiums are not to be trifled with."

"Understood," Tawnya said. "I’ll keep my channels secure."

Alli turned back to Cristionna. "I want you to discreetly probe around, but focus on that merchant. Something doesn't sit right with me, and I cannot allow this internal squabbling and risk a war with our allies the Dragonborn."

She sighed, running a hand through her dark hair. "It seems everyone is trying to take a piece of my power or put me against a wall."

“We won’t allow that, Alli,” Cristionna assured her.

The room fell silent again, each woman lost in her own thoughts. Alli was a cornered beast, plotting to strike down those who dared challenge her power. Cristionna the composed councilor was now embroiled in a dangerous game of intrigue and subterfuge. Tawnya, the silent sentinel, was sharpening her blades, preparing for a fight.

As for me, Cristionna thought, it's time I sought out what Bettina has been up to. The pieces are falling, but the puzzle is still in shambles.

Alli took a deep breath, steeling herself. "Alright, Tawnya. Let's go back to the Merchant Guild archives. See if we can find anything else to connect Stonehand directly to Vayne…or to whoever is truly behind this mess."

Tawnya nodded, her expression grim. “It will be done, Alli. But…the archives are heavily guarded. It won’t be as simple as just walking in."

“We have access. We go through the motions and protocols. If questioned, it is for the good of Porthaven.” Alli replied with a calm surety in her tone. “I have to protect myself against Vayne and the rest of these greedy worms.”

The pair left Cristionna's chambers, the silence between them thick with purpose. Alli walked with a newfound determination, a storm brewing beneath her composed surface. Tawnya, as always, was a silent bulwark at her side, her presence a comfort and a warning all at once.

The Merchant Guild Archives loomed large in the twilight, its stone facade casting long shadows. Guards stood at attention near the entrance, their eyes scanning the surroundings with practiced vigilance. Alli flashed her signet ring, a subtle display of authority that parted the way without a word. The guards, well-versed in the nuances of power, simply nodded and allowed them passage.

Inside, the archives were a labyrinth of towering shelves, each crammed with meticulously organized records. The air was thick with the scent of aged parchment and dust, a testament to the countless hours of work that had been poured into preserving the city's mercantile history.

"Where do we begin?" Tawnya asked, her voice echoing softly in the cavernous space.

Alli scanned the rows, her eyes narrowed in concentration. "Stonehand's trade deals. Let's see if we can find anything that wasn't filed through the proper channels, anything that was deliberately obscured or mislabeled."

They spent the next hour meticulously examining the records, their fingers tracing over ledgers, trade agreements, and correspondence. The work was tedious and painstaking, but Alli was relentless, her focus unwavering. Tawnya, with her keen eyes and methodical approach, was an invaluable asset.

"Alli," Tawnya said suddenly, pointing to a stack of documents tucked away in a dimly lit corner. "These shipments…they’re all listed as 'miscellaneous goods,' but the quantities are far too large for that designation."

Alli approached, her gaze following Tawnya's finger. She picked up one of the documents, her eyes scanning the densely packed text. "And the origin points are…unclear. These could be anything, coming from anywhere."

"They seem to be routed through Stonehand's holding companies," Tawnya added. "The same companies that Cristionna flagged."

Alli nodded grimly. "This is getting interesting. Let’s cross reference them with the shipments coming into Porthaven. The same records that point to the deals with the dragonborns.”

They continued to sift through the documents, their growing sense of urgency filling the quiet space. As they matched incoming manifests with outgoing shipments, a clearer picture began to emerge.

"These goods…they're not being declared properly," Alli said, her voice tight with anger. "Stonehand is underreporting their value, skimming off the top, and funneling the money…somewhere."

"Could be Vayne," Tawnya grumbled. "Or whoever put Vayne up to this scheme to destabilize the human-dragon alliance.”

Alli slammed her fist on the table, the sound echoing through the archives. "They’re undermining the foundations of our alliance! What do they hope to achieve? War? Chaos?"

She paused, taking a deep breath to compose herself. "We need to find out where that money is going, Tawnya. That's where the true answer lies." She looked up at the massive woman. "I need you to call in your contacts in the underbelly of Porthaven. See what rumors they are hearing of people gaining wealth or moving money under the table. I need to ensure I know who can be bought so I know how to protect my people."

Tawnya nodded grimly. "I will, Alli. And...be careful. I don't like how deeply this goes.”

Alli met Tawnya's gaze, her own eyes filled with determination. "I can handle it. And together we will ensure that no one undermines Porthaven or our place on the council." She turned back to the documents, a renewed sense of purpose fueling her actions. The hunt had begun, and she would not rest until she uncovered the truth, no matter how dangerous it might be. As they returned to poring over the ledgers, Alli couldn't help but wonder just how far the rot extended and who else would turn up to betray her.

Alli leaned back in her ornate chair, the weight of the discovered information pressing down on her. "So, Stonehand is skimming, underreporting… and where is the extra money going? Is it to fund the conspiracy against me, or is it funding another source? War, chaos…and for what reason?" she asked, more to herself than to Tawnya. The thought was both terrifying and infuriating. She ran a hand through her meticulously styled hair, disrupting its perfect arrangement. She needed to think. Clear her mind of distractions.

"Tawnya is out, seeking more insight for both our sake. What do you plan to do in the meanwhile, Alli?" she asked, her gaze sweeping around the room.

The private chambers were, as always, impeccably tidy. The faint scent of lavender and sandalwood hung in the air, a stark contrast to the stink of corruption she’d just been wading through. Tapestries depicting heroic Draconic figures adorned the walls, reminders of the alliance she was fighting to protect. On a small table, a half-finished game of strategy sat waiting, a silent challenge that she usually relished. Tonight, however, it felt like a mockery. How could she focus on tactical maneuvers on a game board when a real, potentially devastating game was being played all around her?

"I need to see if the information lines up with our information from the outside. We need to look at the messages passed down from Stonehand, both the legal and the ones that were buried away." she said aloud, standing up and marching over to a locked chest. She opened it with a delicate motion and began pulling out documents. After a few moments, she spotted a series of official looking missives, still bearing Stonehand's seal.

"This is all above board" she confirmed, "or it appears to be. Tawnya will know how to best see these when she arrives back. But, just to be sure," she said, eyeing the missives.

With a delicate flick of her wrist, a small, silver dagger appeared in her hand. The blade shimmered in the lamplight, reflecting her own focused gaze. She carefully sliced along the edge of the first missive, separating the official seal from the parchment. Then, with painstaking precision, she began to peel back the seal, layer by layer, revealing a thin strip of empty space underneath. Her expression hardened.

"As I suspected," she muttered. "They wrote underneath the seal, the rat."

She grabbed a magnifying glass, its frame delicately carved with dragon scales, and peered closely at the concealed message. Faint ink markings, barely visible to the naked eye, revealed a series of numbers and letters, a coded message hidden in plain sight. She cross referenced what it said with the shipments going to and from.

After an hour, she threw the magnifying glass on the table. "This is not good," she admitted. "Not only are they underreporting, they are redirecting shipments into the hands of organizations that want this alliance to fall apart."

Alli paced back and forth, her mind racing. She had been so focused on the overt acts of sabotage that she had missed the subtle currents flowing beneath the surface. Stonehand was more than just a greedy merchant; he was a key player in a much larger game.

Her thoughts were interrupted by a soft knock on the door. "Enter," she called out, her voice sharper than she intended.

Tawnya stepped into the room, her broad face etched with concern. "I have news," she announced, her voice low and gravelly. "My contacts have been hearing rumors of large sums of money changing hands, whispers of secret deals and… gatherings. The kind that never bode well.”

Alli met Tawnya's gaze, her heart sinking. "Tell me," she urged, bracing herself for what she was about to hear.

"Apparently Vayne has been funding several smaller organizations that have previously had smaller deals that were blocked by my trade deals, to keep prices regulated. Now he is turning these small groups of rebels into larger organizations with a singular goal: To overthrow me and install someone who cares less about the alliance and more about coin," Tawnya explained, her eyes burning with barely suppressed rage. "It is all going exactly as we feared. Vayne and others are seeking to destabilize and ruin my reputation."

Alli nodded grimly. The pieces were falling into place, painting a picture more dire than she had imagined. "Then they want to plunge us into chaos. Good to know they value the dragons not at all." She looked up at Tawnya, her eyes filled with a steely resolve. "We need to move quickly. Now more than ever, Tawnya, but we need to be smart and deliberate. Now how would you suggest to move this further?"
