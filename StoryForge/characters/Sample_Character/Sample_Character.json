The elders taught her the ancient art of palmistry, believing the life force pulsing through the veins could be read in the hands \u2013 a potent ability for a vampire.

As her gift grew, so did her practical duties: training the tribe's monstrous mounts and cleaning up the\u2026 messes. She excelled, her enhanced senses perfect for scenting out ailments and emotional states, her enhanced strength essential for keeping creatures and her surroundings in order.
