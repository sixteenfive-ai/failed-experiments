## StoryForge
An attempt at building an AI-based story generator. Someone might be able to turn this into something good at some point but right now it's a bit of a mess.

### How to run
Add your geminikey.txt to StoryForge root then run the .bat (or run app.py in python). Requires characters in a certain format. 

### Samples
I left a sample character to show the format.

I also left a sample story, this is more as a sample for why I feel like this experiment is a failure. I think with TONS of tuning and tweaking, you might be able to get something that doesn't feel like it's shittily written by a 13-year-old, but I don't want to put that time in.
