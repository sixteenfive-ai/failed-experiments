For all the failed experiments I've made in the past

## StoryForge
- A story generation tool. Takes a bunch of characters, calls Gemini to generate stuff.
- Why it's a failure: Tuning this is going to take too much time and write now it spits out stories that read like they were written by a 13 year old with no writing skills but really good grammar.
