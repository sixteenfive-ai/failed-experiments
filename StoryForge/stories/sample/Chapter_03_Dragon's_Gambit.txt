Martie squinted harder, the glass amplifying the minute details of the ledger entries. Her nose was practically touching the parchment. "Grimbold Stonehand, that weasel," she muttered, tracing a line with a grimy finger. "He's been busy. Look at the quantities here – 'ores of questionable origin,' 'luxury silks destined for…unspecified locations,' and a rather alarming number of 'portable smelting kits.'" She lowered the glass, her brow furrowed. "Definitely up to no good. But this...this is bigger than just fencing stolen goods."

Bettina, feeling the claustrophobia of Martie's cluttered workshop pressing in on her, resumed her pacing. The rhythmic tap of her heeled boots against the uneven wooden floor was the only other sound besides Martie's grumbling. The flickering lamplight danced across the walls, highlighting the bizarre collection of cogs, springs, and half-finished automatons that served as both decoration and testament to Martie’s unique skillset. She paused, picking up a section of forged Draconic parchment. It was a trade agreement, meticulously aged and creased, but Bettina recognized the telltale signs of Martie's handiwork – a subtle unevenness in the ink, a deliberate imperfection in the watermark. She ran a finger over the rough surface, her mind already several steps ahead.

"I think I have a plan," Bettina announced, turning to face Martie. "A direct approach. We know Alli Celio is involved. Let's confront her with the information."

Martie scoffed, putting down the magnifying glass with a clatter. "Confront her? Bettina, are you mad? Alli Celio is not some back-alley pickpocket. She's got connections, resources… people *disappear* who cross her."

Bettina smirked, unfazed. "That's why we go in with leverage. The coded message, Grimbold’s ledger… It's enough to…encourage cooperation. We blackmail her, Martie."

The word hung in the air, heavy with implication. Martie visibly recoiled. "Blackmail? That's… risky. Excessively so! We could just hand this over to the authorities. Let *them* deal with it."

Bettina shook her head. "The authorities are likely already compromised. Celio has deep pockets. Besides," she added, a glint in her eye, "this is about more than just doing the right thing, isn’t it? It's about profit. Think of the potential payout, Martie. Enough to set us both up for life."

Martie chewed on her lip, her expression a mix of apprehension and calculating greed. "Profit is… compelling," she admitted, grudgingly. "But Celio is dangerous. And she will know if you are lying. Or have ulterior motives."

"I can handle her," Bettina said, her voice laced with a confidence that bordered on arrogance. "I’ve dealt with worse." She didn't elaborate, but Martie could guess at the shadows in Bettina's past – the life of a mercenary etched in every line of her face.

Martie sighed, rubbing her tired eyes. "Alright, alright. Let's say, *hypothetically,* we go along with this… ill-advised scheme. How do you propose we approach her? We can’t just knock on her door and announce our intention to extort her. She will skin you alive. Figuratively."

"Subtlety is key," Bettina said, her mind racing. "I'll present myself as… offering my services. An information broker, perhaps. Someone with valuable knowledge, seeking mutually beneficial partnerships." She paused, thinking. "I'll set up a meeting. A neutral location. Somewhere public, but discreet."

"And I?" Martie asked.

"You stay here, with all the incriminating evidence," Bettina said. "Just in case things go south." She paused, a wry smile playing on her lips. "And perhaps start working on a convincing forgery of…oh, I don’t know, the trade laws pertaining to certain Draconic trade lanes."

Martie managed a weak smile. "Always good to have a backup plan."

They continued to refine the plan, mapping out the approach, rehearsing the language Bettina would use. Bettina emphasized the importance of maintaining composure and not revealing the full extent of their knowledge too early. Martie, though still apprehensive, contributed her own insights, suggesting subtle psychological tactics to unsettle Celio. She brought up some old research from her time "working" for the criminal guilds. It's was surprisingly insightful.

Finally, as the first hint of dawn began to paint the sky, they finalized the details. "Remember, Bettina," Martie said, her voice laced with concern. "Be careful. Alli Celio is not to be trifled with."

Bettina nodded, her expression serious for once. "I understand the risks, Martie. But the potential reward is worth it. Besides," she added, a flicker of her characteristic confidence returning, "I have a feeling this is going to be… interesting." She patted the pouch at her side where she held her decoded message. "She will take me seriously now."

Bettina turned to leave, her boots clicking against the floor once more. As she reached the door, she paused, looking back at Martie. "One more thing. If I disappear… make sure that music box gets to the noblewoman. It would be a shame to waste all that effort."

With that, she stepped out into the cool morning air, leaving Martie alone in her workshop, surrounded by cogs, springs, and the daunting prospect of forging a Draconic trade agreement. The game was afoot, and Bettina was ready to play. The coming days were certainly going to be… interesting.

The chill morning air nipped at Bettina's exposed cheeks as she stepped out of Martie’s workshop and into the awakening city. The first rays of sunlight painted the cobblestone streets in hues of gold and rose, chasing away the lingering shadows of the night. She pulled her cloak tighter around herself, the familiar weight of her weapons a comforting presence beneath the fabric.

“Interesting indeed,” she murmured to herself, echoing her parting words to Martie. The coded message, the alliance with a morally dubious forger, the sheer audacity of confronting Alli Celio – it was a volatile cocktail of risk and opportunity, precisely the kind of challenge that ignited a spark in her blood.

She needed to clear her head, to solidify her strategy before the day truly began. A walk through the marketplace would provide both a cover and a chance to observe the pulse of the city, to gauge the whispers and rumors that often revealed more than official proclamations ever did.

Bettina turned towards the bustling heart of Porthaven, the aroma of freshly baked bread and exotic spices already filling the air. The marketplace was a chaotic symphony of sights, sounds, and smells – merchants hawking their wares, shoppers haggling over prices, children chasing pigeons, and stray dogs scavenging for scraps. She navigated the throng with practiced ease, her eyes constantly scanning her surroundings, a hawk searching for prey.

"Finest silks from the Eastern Isles! Only the best for Porthaven's discerning clientele!"

"Get your fresh fish here! Straight from the docks this morning! Lively as can be!"

The cacophony swirled around her, but Bettina filtered it out, focusing instead on the undercurrents – the furtive glances, the hushed conversations, the subtle shifts in body language that betrayed hidden agendas. This marketplace was more than just a place to buy and sell; it was a nexus of information, a breeding ground for intrigue.

She paused near the public notice board, a weathered wooden structure plastered with advertisements, announcements, and proclamations. Most of it was mundane – lost pets, wanted posters for petty thieves, notices of upcoming festivals. But Bettina was searching for something more… subtle. Something that might hint at Celio’s activities, or the movements of her associates.

She skimmed the postings, her eyes darting across the page. Then, a small, unassuming advertisement caught her attention. "Skilled Negotiators Wanted. Discretion Assured. Apply at the Golden Barrel Inn, room 7, after sunset."

A skilled negotiator. Discretion assured. The Golden Barrel Inn, a notorious den of smugglers and back-alley deals. It was too perfect to be a coincidence. Celio, no doubt, used these intermediaries for her clandestine dealings. This could be a back door into her operation, a way to understand the true scope of her network.

Bettina committed the details to memory, making a mental note to investigate the Golden Barrel Inn at the first opportunity. It was unlikely she'd apply to be a negotiator herself, not with Celio's eyes on her, but perhaps she could observe, gather intel, maybe even… recruit.

"Watch where you're going, you oaf!" a gruff voice snapped.

Bettina snapped back to attention. She turned to see a burly man with a scowl as dark as a thundercloud, glaring at her. He must not have liked her blocking his way.

"Apologies," she said smoothly, stepping aside. A less guarded persona might have sparked at the man's insult, but now was not the time. She had larger goals to accomplish than letting a brute knock her off course. She didn't need a brawl so soon. "My mind was elsewhere."

The man grunted, dismissing her with a wave of his hand. Bettina continued her stroll through the marketplace, but her focus had sharpened. She could sense danger in this place, the kind of danger that could swallow her whole if she wasn't careful.

As she walked, her mind began racing with possible approaches for her meeting with Celio. Should she present herself as an independent broker? Or perhaps imply that she represented a rival faction, someone else vying for Celio's lucrative trade routes? What information should she reveal, and what should she hold back?

The key, she decided, was to control the narrative. To appear confident, knowledgeable, and utterly indispensable. Celio needed to see her as an asset, not a threat. She was going to bait her just so, so carefully. Celio must think Bettina was the perfect choice for *her* needs.

Bettina smiled grimly. She could make that happen. After all, she was quite skilled at playing whatever role was needed. And right now, the role was that of a skilled negotiator.

She just had to convince Alli Celio that she was worth the price. Even if that price was her own soul.

Bettina sat at a small, lacquered table in the corner of the Tranquil Teapot, a tea house whose name belied the nervous energy thrumming within her. The aroma of jasmine and steamed milk hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the clandestine meeting she was about to conduct. She sipped her green tea, the delicate flavor doing little to calm the butterflies fluttering in her stomach. The tea was meant to soothe, but the caffeine worked to only raise her pulse.

She subtly scanned the room. A pair of gnomes gossiped animatedly near the counter, their voices a high-pitched hum. A lone elf, cloaked in shadow, nursed a cup of something dark and steaming. And over near the large picture window, a trio of dwarven merchants counted coins, their gruff voices occasionally punctuated by a clatter of metal. None of them seemed to be paying her any mind. Good.

A shadow fell across her table. Bettina looked up, meeting the steely gaze of Alli Celio. The woman radiated an aura of controlled power, her every movement precise, every expression carefully calibrated. She wore a simple, yet impeccably tailored, crimson dress, and a silver necklace with a scale pendant hung around her neck. A small and clear display of who she was.

Bettina rose smoothly, offering a polite smile. "Mistress Celio. Thank you for agreeing to meet with me."

"Bettina, is it?" Celio's voice was low, like the purr of a predator. "Please, sit. No need for formality." She gestured towards the chair opposite Bettina and settled into it with an effortless grace that seemed almost predatory.

Bettina sat. "I appreciate you taking the time."

"Time is a precious commodity, Bettina. I don't waste it on idle chatter. I trust you have something… of interest to discuss?" Celio's eyes, a sharp, piercing blue, locked onto hers.

Bettina took another sip of her tea, stalling for a moment as she prepared her opening gambit. She set the cup down gently. "Indeed, I do. I’ve come across some… information. Information that pertains to your… business dealings." She let the words hang in the air, watching Celio’s reaction.

Celio’s expression remained impassive, betraying nothing. "Go on."

Bettina reached into her satchel, extracting a carefully wrapped packet. She slid it across the table. "I believe this is something you'd prefer remain private."

Celio raised an eyebrow, but didn’t immediately reach for the packet. "And what makes you think I'd be willing to discuss private matters with… someone like you?"

Bettina allowed a hint of steel to enter her voice. "Because the alternative is far less palatable. I have… other avenues of distribution, should you be unwilling to cooperate." A blatant, ugly, truth, delivered gently. She had no *other* avenues. She needed this gamble to work.

Celio finally reached out, her fingers slender and strong as she unwrapped the packet. Inside lay a carefully copied excerpt from the coded message, specifically the section detailing the manipulation of trade routes in the Draconic territories. Celio’s eyes narrowed as she scanned the text.

A tense silence filled the air. Bettina watched Celio closely, searching for any flicker of emotion. Was it working? Had she overplayed her hand?

Finally, Celio looked up, her gaze cold and assessing. "Interesting. But hardly conclusive."

Bettina pressed her advantage. "Perhaps not on its own. But coupled with the list of transactions involving Grimbold Stonehand…"

Celio cut her off with a sharp gesture. "Enough. You've made your point. You possess information that could potentially be… inconvenient."

"Potentially?" Bettina smiled thinly. "I'd say definitively."

Celio leaned back in her chair, considering her. "Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that what you claim is true. What is it you want?"

Bettina’s heart leaped. The woman was biting.

"I'm a pragmatist, Mistress Celio. I value discretion, loyalty, and above all, profit. I propose a… mutually beneficial arrangement."

"An arrangement?"

"I will remain silent about this information. In exchange, you compensate me for my… discretion." Bettina kept her gaze steady, matching Celio’s intensity.

Celio chuckled softly, a sound that sent a shiver down Bettina’s spine. "Blackmail, then? You’re rather brazen, aren't you?"

"I prefer to think of it as… strategic negotiation." Bettina leaned forward slightly, her voice dropping to a near whisper. "But I'm open to other suggestions. Perhaps...I could help identify who exposed this?"

Celio's eyes gleamed with something that might have been amusement. "Ah. So you have more to offer than just silence." She paused, tapping a manicured finger against the table. "Perhaps… Perhaps this could work." She glanced around the room, ensuring they weren't overheard.

"Tell me, Bettina. What do you know about this message?"

Bettina delicately placed the copy of the decoded message on the table between them, the encoded portions clearly highlighted with a faint, alchemical marker. Alli’s eyes narrowed further as she scanned the document again, her gaze darting from one detail to the next with unnerving speed. Bettina’s palms were starting to sweat, but she forced herself to remain calm.

“This message,” Bettina began, carefully modulating her voice to project both confidence and a subtle undercurrent of threat, “came into my possession quite… unexpectedly. It’s origin isn't relevant for this discussion but trust, it isn’t somewhere it belongs.”

She watched Celio’s face, noting the slight tightening of her jaw. The woman was a master of composure, but Bettina had spent enough time around cardsharps and grifters to recognize the telltale signs of suppressed anger.

"As you can see, Mistress Celio, its implications are… significant. Trade routes, resource diversions… a network of considerable size. All pointing to one… person," Bettina stated as she watched the other woman's reaction.

She paused, letting the weight of her words sink in, then subtly hinted at her understanding of the potential impact. "I believe that someone with access to this information could… destabilize the current market in Draconic territory. Severely."

Celio’s eyes remained fixed on the message, but Bettina sensed a shift in her focus. The woman was no longer merely assessing the document; she was calculating, weighing her options.

Bettina decided to press on, seizing the opportunity while she had it. “I propose a ‘mutually beneficial arrangement,’ as I’ve already stated. An arrangement which ensures my continued… discretion. In exchange, you'd have my loyalty."

Bettina sat there and tried to be impassive as possible, hoping Alli didn't see that she had just bet all her savings.

Celio finally looked up, her eyes piercing through Bettina like shards of ice. "And what, pray tell, does that loyalty entail?"

Bettina took a slow breath. This was it. The crux of the entire gamble. “That, Mistress Celio, depends entirely on your needs. I have… certain skills. I'm… resourcefull" She omitted the specifics, such as forgery, lockpicking, and an uncanny ability to find things that people desperately wanted to keep hidden. “Let’s just say that I can be… useful.”

Celio considered her words, her gaze unwavering. "Useful how? You seem more suited to finding information than providing any actual assistance."

Bettina smirked ever so slightly. It was amusing to see Alli actually think that she was a one trick pony. "Perhaps I should have listed all my strengths. I understand people. More importantly I know how to persuade them... without force. I have a knack for discovering the truth, and I can adapt quickly to any situation. Skills that I’ve honed. Over many years. As I said, I can be quite useful."

Celio folded her hands on the table, her expression unreadable. “And what if I simply refuse your… offer? What then, Mistress…?” She paused, as if daring Bettina to repeat her name.

“Bettina. Just Bettina.” Bettina held her gaze. “Then… I would be forced to explore those ‘other avenues’ I mentioned earlier.” She hated lying, but it was necessary. She had no other avenues. The shield, and the subsequent blackmail, had been a calculated risk. But in her heart, if she failed she knew that she could disappear into Porthaven's underworld again.

Celio’s lips curled into a faint smile, a smile that didn’t reach her eyes. "A pity. I was hoping you were a more sensible woman. Do you expect me to believe that you wouldn’t regret going against me, and simply take the risk that comes with being my enemy? Have you not looked at my reputation at all?"

Bettina held back from flinching. This woman had money, and she could be an enemy like no other. One wrong move and Bettina could have a dagger in her ribs by sun down. "Regret is a luxury I cannot afford. I am simply attempting to play the cards I have been dealt to the best of my ability."

Celio laughed softly, but there was no humor in it. "You are playing a dangerous game, Bettina. One that could easily get you killed."

Bettina leaned forward again, her voice barely a whisper. "Perhaps. But the reward… the potential profit… is worth the risk. Isn't it? The information can make or break kingdoms. I'd expect to be valued appropriately for it."

Celio sat back in her chair, studying Bettina with an intensity that made her want to squirm. The silence stretched, thick and heavy, punctuated only by the gentle clinking of teacups in the nearby tables.

Finally, Celio spoke. "Alright, Bettina. Let's talk about this… arrangement."

Celio laced her fingers together, resting her chin upon them, her gaze fixed on Bettina. "Let's say, hypothetically, that I entertain your proposition. What guarantee do I have that you won't simply take my money and run? Or worse, that you won't betray me to someone else for an even greater reward?"

Bettina met her gaze unflinchingly. "My word. And the understanding that breaking my word to you would be… extremely detrimental to my health. Besides, consider the alternative. Who else knows about the contents of that parchment? How many others did you show before you knew that it had been stolen? Who else has heard me speaking about it? The answer is none, isn't it? Only Martie does, and I trust her with my life." She held her tongue, deciding it wasn't prudent to reveal the truth that Martie only learned of its nature mere hours ago. "I have every incentive to see this through, as there would be grave consequences if it were revealed what the message was implying. And I am someone that is loyal to those that value my services. Isn't that what you want, someone who understands the stakes? I guarantee if you give me the same respect as Martie does, you'll get the exact same result"

Celio's eyes narrowed slightly. "Martie, eh? The forger?" A ghost of a smile touched her lips. "You certainly move in… interesting circles."

Bettina simply shrugged. "One must utilize the resources at one's disposal. And Martie is exceptionally skilled." Bettina knew, from Martie’s subtle signals, that she wasn’t as fond of Alli. Bettina wondered idly why they were once allied, and how they split off to become more than just partners. “Besides, it's not about trust, Mistress Celio. It's about mutually assured… benefit. I need you to protect me, and you need me to silence everyone else. No feelings attached. A business transaction.”

Celio leaned back in her chair, her expression thoughtful. "Very well, Bettina. I'll bite. You want me to tell you to investigate the source of the message. What do I receive in return? I'd like you to work until the matter is settled, until I'm convinced the message is no longer a threat to me." She tapped a manicured nail against the table. "But consider this… if you find nothing, will you simply walk away? Or will you continue to… ‘explore avenues’ that might lead to my… discomfort?"

Bettina considered her words carefully. Celio was clearly testing her, probing for any sign of weakness or deception. "If I find nothing, and I am certain that there is truly nothing to find, then I will, of course, walk away. My goal is not to cause discomfort, but to ensure my own… well-being. If you wish, I can come back with regular updates and make sure the source is truly cold" she emphasized. "However, if I *do* find something… if I uncover evidence of a conspiracy, a betrayal, or any other nefarious activity… then my price will increase accordingly."

Celio raised an eyebrow. "A sliding scale of blackmail, how quaint. And how would you determine the appropriate price for such… discoveries?"

Bettina allowed a small smile to play on her lips. "That, Mistress Celio, would depend on the value of the information. And I assure you, I am a shrewd negotiator." Bettina had a feeling she was being goaded to be more confident. She knew she could be useful for this employer, and that it was necessary to hold all her cards at once. If anything, she wanted to show she was playing fairly and not leading them to doom.

Celio chuckled, a low, throaty sound that sent a shiver down Bettina's spine. "Indeed. I suspect you are. Very well, Bettina. I accept your terms. You will investigate the source of this message. You will uncover who created it, who sent it, and why. And in return, I will provide you with the resources you need to do so. And, of course, a… generous reward upon completion." She paused, her eyes gleaming with something that Bettina couldn’t quite decipher. "But be warned, Bettina. I do not tolerate failure. Or betrayal. Cross me, and you will regret it. Profoundly."

Bettina nodded, her heart pounding in her chest. She had done it. She had successfully blackmailed one of the most powerful people in Porthaven and convinced her to hire her, all in one fell swoop. Now, all she had to do was deliver.

"Understood, Mistress Celio. I will not disappoint you."

Celio steepled her fingers again, her gaze unwavering. "See that you don't, Bettina. See that you don't." She abruptly sat back, looking at the rafters of the tea house. "Now, what can I do to ensure you don't betray me, or reveal it's contents?"

She then turned back to Bettina, her eyes glinting for a moment. “Tawnya. Bring the scroll back.”

From the entrance of the tea house, there was the tapping of a pair of heeled boots, revealing a goliath of a woman who came towards the table. Her skin was dark, and she had a pair of twin hatchets on each hip.

“Mistress Celio, what is your command?”

“Bring the scroll to Mistress Bettina. And ensure that it’s handled with grace.”

Tawnya gave a nod, took out the scroll, and handed it to Bettina. As she handed it to her, she kept eye contact and made sure that she made a very serious point to note that she should think about this job. After, she went back to her post at the front, hands behind her back, and standing vigilant.

Bettina breathed a sigh of relief, "This should prove my honesty. Let me get to work."

Bettina accepted the scroll from Tawnya, careful not to let her fingers linger even a fraction of a second longer than necessary. The woman’s silent warning hung in the air, a tangible weight. 

"This should prove my honesty. Let me get to work." Bettina echoed, more for her own reassurance than for Celio’s benefit.

Celio’s lips curved into a predatory smile. "Indeed. Though a scroll proves nothing, Bettina. It is but a tool. Your actions, however, will speak volumes." She steepled her fingers again, her gaze sharpening. "My first instruction is simple. Determine the origins of this cursed message, and do not let me down in your search."

Bettina met her gaze unflinchingly, her mind already racing through possibilities. "Of course. However, I must ask, what resources can you offer for this task? I have a contact that might be useful, but if you were to help…"

"Specify. Do you need gold? Information? Access to certain… individuals?" Celio inquired, her tone implying that she had resources of all kinds at her disposal.

"Both would be appreciated, and I might have some more requests later. I have a colleague that deciphered the script, she can be useful." Bettina was thankful for her idea to not immediately dispose of her only lead, "But, for the moment, I could use a… background check. I believe the message originated somewhere within the Paladin's Order."

Celio nodded slowly. "The Paladin's Order… a tangled web of honor and deceit. Very well. I will have my contacts within the city provide you with any relevant information they possess regarding recent… indiscretions within the Order. Consider it a starting point." She snapped her fingers, and Tawnya moved silently to her side. "Tawnya will escort you to the Grey Scales office. You will have access to their files. Do not abuse this privilege, Bettina. Their records are… sensitive."

Grey Scales, Bettina knew, was the name of Celio's private investigation firm. It was a place whispered about in hushed tones, a repository of secrets and leverage. Gaining access was a significant advantage, one that could expedite her investigation considerably. However, it also meant stepping further into Celio’s web, where every move would be scrutinized. She hoped to gleam some secrets and make an ally of Tawnya.

"I understand, Mistress Celio," Bettina said, careful to keep her tone respectful. "I will treat the information with the utmost discretion."

Celio studied her for a moment longer, as if trying to gauge the sincerity of her words. "See that you do." She rose gracefully to her feet, a signal that the meeting was concluded. "I expect regular updates, Bettina. Do not hesitate to contact me if you encounter any… difficulties. Or any… interesting developments."

Bettina stood as well, a sense of cautious optimism warring with a knot of apprehension in her stomach. "I will, Mistress Celio. Thank you for your trust." Trust? She internally scoffed. Celio was buying information, and making a statement of dominance.

Celio offered a curt nod, then turned and swept out of the tea house, Tawnya shadowing her like a silent guardian. As they disappeared into the bustling streets of Porthaven, Bettina let out a shaky breath.

*Now*, she thought, *the real work begins.*

She looked down at the scroll in her hand, the coded message a tangible reminder of the danger she had invited into her life. Her alliance with Celio was a perilous gamble, a dance on the edge of a razor. One wrong step, and she could find herself on the wrong side of a powerful and ruthless woman.

But the potential rewards were undeniable. The information Celio possessed, the resources she could bring to bear… it was an opportunity to rise above her current circumstances, to secure a future of comfort and security. If she can take this money and run that is. But she was in deep at this point. The Paladin Order and Celio are definitely the types to come back for a late debt.

And then there was Martie. Bettina couldn't forget her partner in this venture. She would need to be careful, to protect Martie from the fallout of her deal with Celio. The satyr message was in her debt after all. A promise is a promise, or else how can one expect to be employed.

She glanced towards the entrance of the tea house, where Tawnya still stood, a silent sentinel. It was clear that she would be watched, her every move monitored.

She steeled her resolve, pushing aside her doubts and fears. She had a task to complete, a debt to repay, and a future to secure. She tucked the scroll safely into her coat, then turned and headed towards the entrance, towards Tawnya and the promise of the Grey Scales office, and towards the tangled web of secrets and lies that awaited her.

Bettina approached Tawnya, the woman's presence a solid wall of muscle and barely contained energy. The Grey Scales operative was clad in unassuming, if well-tailored, attire, but Bettina saw the coiled tension in her shoulders, the way her eyes scanned the crowd with practiced ease. This was no mere bodyguard; Tawnya was a weapon, honed and ready.

"Mistress Celio instructed me to escort you to the office, and provide any assistance you require. Do you have further instructions before we depart?", Tawnya said, her voice a low rumble that resonated more than it projected. Her eyes remained locked on Bettina, awaiting her command.

*Assistance, huh? Or surveillance? Probably both,* Bettina mused internally. It would be foolish to underestimate Tawnya's role in this arrangement. She was Celio's eyes and ears, ensuring Bettina remained on the leash. "No, that's fine," Bettina replied, keeping her tone neutral. "Let's go."

The pair moved through Porthaven's bustling streets, Tawnya a silent shadow at Bettina's side. Bettina tried to appear nonchalant, studying the shops and stalls as if she were merely window-shopping, but beneath the facade, her mind raced. She had to figure out how to leverage this situation, how to use Celio's resources without becoming Celio's puppet. She would also have to warn Martie of her decision and see how this new situation affected their deal.

The Grey Scales office was located in a seemingly ordinary building, sandwiched between a tailor shop and a purveyor of exotic teas. The only indication of its true nature was the discreet grey gryphon emblem etched into the door. Subtle enough to be missed by a casual observer, but Bettina knew the mark now.

Tawnya produced a key and unlocked the door, holding it open for Bettina. The interior was surprisingly subdued, a stark contrast to Celio's opulent mansion. The walls were lined with bookshelves, crammed with leather-bound tomes and stacks of files. Desks were neatly arranged, each with a lamp casting a pool of light on its surface. A faint scent of ink and old parchment hung in the air. It looked more like a legal office than a private investigation firm.

“Mistress Celio has granted you access to all unclassified case files and trade route information. You will find what you need on the encrypted drives in the records room." Tawnya indicated a heavy oak door at the back of the office. “Do not attempt to access classified information. It will be noted."

Bettina nodded slowly. Celio’s warning hung heavy in the air.

“Very well,” Bettina said. "I'll begin with the trade routes then." That was the crux of Celio's manipulation, the lifeblood of her illicit operations. If she could trace the flow of resources, she might uncover the source of Celio's growing army. More than that, she might be able to find evidence that Celio would rather be kept hidden. Maybe enough to sell that blackmail material off too! Celio has proven untrustworthy, so nothing is stopping me from doing the same.

Tawnya inclined her head. “I will be in the outer office if you require anything.” She moved to one of the desks, her back straight and watchful.

Bettina walked to the records room, the heavy door closing behind her with a soft thud. The room was smaller than she expected, filled with metal filing cabinets and a single desk. A terminal sat atop the desk, its screen dark and inactive. She ran a hand over the cool metal, taking a deep breath before powering on the terminal.

The screen flickered to life, displaying a login prompt. After some searching she located a slip of parchment with a username and password. A single line was added. "They are watching. Make them chase only shadows." What did Celio mean by that? Bettina typed in the credentials and logged in, her heart pounding in her chest.

As the system booted up, she glanced back at the door, imagining Tawnya’s gaze boring through the wood. She couldn't shake the feeling of being watched, of being a pawn in a game far larger than herself.

*Alright, Bettina*, she told herself, *time to play the game.*

The system was compartmentalized into case files and financial records. Navigating into the trade section, she began her search. Spreadsheets, lists of contacts, locations. The web she was walking into was deeper than she had ever suspected. But maybe she could not only find a way out, but pull herself upwards in the process.

Bettina leaned back against the rough brick of her room's wall, the flickering candlelight casting dancing shadows across the parchment spread before her. The map of Porthaven, usually a source of comfort and familiarity, now seemed like a web of possibilities, each alleyway a potential hiding place, each market stall a source of whispered secrets.

Hours had passed since she'd left Celio’s seemingly innocuous front business. The encrypted drives contained a mountain of information, seemingly designed to lull her into a false sense of security. The sheer volume of data was overwhelming, a testament to Celio’s vast network and meticulous planning. So many documents and data lists - surely one of them must contain the information she needs to discover who ratted Celio out!

Bettina chewed on her thumbnail, a nervous habit she hadn't broken since childhood. Celio’s words echoed in her mind: *They are watching. Make them chase only shadows.* Was she already chasing shadows? Was this mountain of unclassified information merely a distraction, designed to keep her occupied while Celio pursued her own agenda?

She ran her finger along one of the trade routes marked on the map – a seemingly legitimate shipment of spices from the Eastern Quarter, destined for the noble district. On the surface, it was unremarkable. But the coded message…it spoke of siphoned resources, diverted shipments. Where was the missing piece?

“Think, Bettina, think,” she muttered to herself. “Celio wouldn’t just leave it out in the open. There has to be something hidden, some kind of breadcrumbs.”

Her gaze drifted to the list of contacts she had copied from the terminal. Dozens of names, each one a potential player in Celio’s game. Merchants, dockworkers, guardsmen, even a few nobles. How could she possibly sift through them all?

A name caught her eye: "Grimbold Stonehand." The name was already flagged as connected to Celio. The fence Martie had sold stolen goods to, and who had somehow gotten entangled with Celio and her machinations. It couldn't be a coincidence.

"Alright, Grimbold," Bettina whispered, tapping the parchment with her fingernail. "Let's see what secrets you're hiding."

She reached for her own small ledger, the one she kept hidden beneath the loose floorboard by her bed. In it, she meticulously documented her own dealings, her own network of informants and contacts. It was her insurance policy, her lifeline in this treacherous city.

She flipped through the pages, searching for any mention of Grimbold, or any of his associates. Nothing. He was clearly operating outside her usual circles. Interesting.

*Time for a visit*, she thought, a flicker of excitement sparking in her chest. *But not yet. Not without a plan.*

She returned to the map, tracing the trade routes with her finger. There were several warehouses and storage facilities along the docks, all connected to Celio's network. Perhaps Grimbold was using one of them as a drop-off point, or a place to launder illicit goods.

The Paladin's Shield. Bettina almost forgot. Her eyes fell upon the corner where it was leaning; it's griffon emblem leering as if to remind her. What role did the original owner play in this? She knew that her mission to Porthaven had become something bigger than she planned. 

*Now, what was that message in Celio's files? Something about 'following shadows'...* Her blood ran cold. That had to be a warning for whomever found Celio's records! Celio was one step ahead - was this some trap being sprung on her by Celio's warning?

Bettina’s mind raced, piecing together the fragments of information. Celio was playing a dangerous game, and she was caught in the middle. She needed to be careful, to tread lightly. She couldn’t afford to underestimate Celio, or her network. One wrong move, and she could end up buried beneath the weight of their secrets.

But she also couldn't afford to back down. Not now. She had a deal with Celio, a debt to repay. And besides, she had her own agenda to pursue. Celio's secrets were valuable, and Bettina intended to profit from them.

"Alright, Celio," she murmured, a sly smile spreading across her face. "Let's see who can outsmart who."

She began outlining her plan on a fresh piece of parchment, meticulously noting down potential risks and rewards. She needed allies, trusted individuals who could provide information and support. Martie, of course, was an obvious choice. But who else could she trust?

As the night deepened, Bettina continued to pore over the map, her mind buzzing with possibilities. The game had begun, and she intended to win. Not just for Celio, but for herself. This was more than just blackmail now. It was about power, about control. And Bettina was determined to come out on top, no matter the cost. The Paladin Shield might have just changed her life forever...
