Bettina chewed on the end of her quill, the taste of ink surprisingly bitter. Spread before her on the worn wooden desk were maps of Porthaven’s trading districts, annotated with dates, shipping manifests, and cryptic notes deciphered from Grimbold Stonehand’s ledger. The single lamp cast long shadows across the room, making the cramped Grey Scales office feel even smaller than it was. She re-read Celio’s parting words, the woman’s voice echoing in her mind: *"Make them chase only shadows."*

Celio, she realized, was playing a deeper game than either of them had initially suspected. Shadowy puppeteers pulling at strings she couldn't quite see yet. Which begged the question: whose shadows was *Bettina* supposed to be chasing? And, more importantly, who was trying to get to Celio?

A knot of frustration tightened in her stomach. This wasn't simply about trade routes or illicit profits. This was about power, influence, and potentially something far more dangerous.

She tapped a fingernail against a particularly dense cluster of annotations surrounding the Eastern Docks. Human merchant consortiums dominated that area, each vying for dominance in the lucrative spice trade. They were, by far, the most likely to chafe under Alli Celio’s policies favoring draconic trade agreements. The resentment was a low, constant hum in Porthaven's marketplaces. She was sure it wouldn’t be too hard to believe that they would conspire against her.

Bettina flipped to a fresh sheet of parchment. Time to compile a list. "Obvious targets first," she muttered to herself. "The Merchant Guild. The Spice Harvesters' Collective. The Ironwood Trading Company…" Each name she wrote felt like a pebble dropping into a well, the sound faint but promising greater depths.

But mere resentment wasn't enough to leak a coded message, let alone orchestrate a full-blown plot. Someone, somewhere, had access to sensitive information and the means to disseminate it. Someone who also had the desire to throw her under the proverbial bus. Or, at the very least, get her stuck in Celio’s service.

She sighed and leaned back in her chair. "Alright, time for the less obvious ones." She was going to need contacts, preferably ones that wouldn’t immediately alert Celio, but those are hard to come by.

A sharp rap at the door startled her.

"Bettina? You in there?" It was Tawnya, her voice a low rumble that vibrated through the wooden frame.

Bettina quickly shuffled the papers into a semblance of order. "Come in, Tawnya."

The goliath squeezed through the doorway, her imposing figure filling the small space. She held a tray with a steaming pot and two mugs. "Thought you might need some company. And tea."

"Much appreciated," Bettina said, genuinely relieved. She'd been so engrossed in her thoughts that she'd forgotten how long she'd been at it.

Tawnya set the tray down on the edge of the desk, displacing a stack of manifests. "So, how's the shadow chasing going?" There was a hint of amusement in her voice.

Bettina poured herself a mug of the fragrant tea. "Complicated. Celio seems to think I'm being led by the nose. That there's nothing to be found."

Tawnya leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed. "And do you think she's right?"

Bettina took a sip of her tea, considering. "No," she said finally. "Someone leaked that message for a reason. Someone wants Celio out of the picture. The real question is: why, and who benefits?"

"Those consortiums seem like a decent start," Tawnya replied, nodding towards the maps. "I overheard a few rumblings when Celio announced those new trade deals with the Dragon Coast. Not everyone was happy about it."

"Exactly," Bettina said, warming to the conversation. "But that’s just the surface. I need to dig deeper. I need information. And that means… socializing."

A glint appeared in Tawnya's eyes. "Ah, so you're going to start using those… skills, Martie mentioned?"

Bettina smirked. "Among other things. Time to see who has a loose tongue and a penchant for gossip. This job has already proven that there’s plenty of both in Porthaven.”

She took another sip of tea, a renewed sense of determination settling within her. The game was afoot, and she was ready to play. It seemed those shadows weren’t so easily chased away after all. She had to catch at least one.

Bettina adjusted the worn messenger bag slung across her chest, the roughspun fabric scratching against her skin. The Whispering Coin Tavern reeked of stale beer, cheap tobacco, and unwashed bodies—a fragrant tapestry of desperation and fleeting hope. Exactly the kind of place disgruntled merchants might drown their sorrows.

"Right," she muttered, taking a deep breath before pushing through the swinging doors. "Operation Loose Lips is a go."

The interior was dimly lit, illuminated by flickering oil lamps that cast long, dancing shadows across the room. The air was thick with the murmur of hushed conversations and the clatter of tankards. Bettina scanned the room, her eyes quickly adjusting to the gloom. She spotted the bar, a long, scarred counter that looked as if it had witnessed more brawls than brews.

"Alright, bartender it is," she thought, walking towards the bar. She needed to approach this subtly. Straightforward questions would only raise suspicion, especially in a place like this. She needed to create a believable persona, and weave her inquiries into casual conversation.

She hopped onto a stool, the wood groaning beneath her weight. "Evening," she said to the bartender, a burly man with a perpetually sour expression. "A pint of your cheapest ale, if you please."

The bartender grunted and slopped a mug of murky liquid in front of her. "That'll be two coppers."

Bettina paid, then took a cautious sip. It tasted like watered-down dirt, but she feigned enjoyment. "Long day of deliveries," she sighed, setting the mug down with a thud. "Up and down the Lower City. Makes a body thirsty."

The bartender wiped down the counter with a rag, his eyes devoid of interest. "That it does."

"Say," Bettina continued, leaning closer, "you see all sorts pass through here, right? Merchants, traders…"

"Some."

"I'm looking for a particular type," she explained, careful to keep her voice low. "Someone…unhappy. Someone who maybe lost a deal, had some bad luck." She watched his face closely, searching for any flicker of recognition. "Heard there’s some merchants in town who aren’t too fond of Alli Celio’s new trade deals."

The bartender’s eyes narrowed slightly. "Celio's got a knack for making enemies. What's it to you?"

Bettina chuckled lightly. "Just curious. Word on the street is, there's some discontent brewing. A courier hears things, you know? Disgruntled clients make for… interesting stories."

She paused, letting the implication hang in the air. Bribery wasn’t off the table.

The bartender remained silent for a moment, his gaze fixed on a point behind her. Finally, he jerked his head towards a dark corner of the tavern. "See that fella over there? Nursing that drink like it's liquid gold?"

Bettina followed his gaze. A man sat hunched over a table in the shadows, his face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat. He was dressed in expensive-looking clothes, but they were rumpled and stained, as if he hadn't changed in days.

"Name's Vorlag," the bartender continued, his voice dropping to a near whisper. "Used to be a big shot in the Merchant Guild. Had a sweet deal exporting spices to the Dragon Coast. Then Celio stepped in, undercut him, and stole his contract."

"Vorlag, eh?" Bettina raised an eyebrow. "And he's… bitter about it?"

The bartender snorted. "Bitter? He's practically marinating in it. Spends most nights here, muttering about Celio and her 'dragon-loving ways.'"

Bettina smirked. "Sounds promising." She drained the last of her ale. "Thanks for the tip."

She slid off the stool and made her way towards Vorlag's corner. As she approached, she could hear him muttering to himself, his words slurred and unintelligible.

This was it. Time to put on her best con artist face.

She pulled up a chair across from him, ignoring his initial glare. "Mind if I join you?" she asked, her voice low and inviting.

Vorlag looked her up and down, his eyes bloodshot and unfocused. "Suit yourself," he mumbled, taking another swig of his drink.

"Rough night?" Bettina asked, feigning sympathy.

Vorlag scoffed. "Rough life." He slammed his mug down on the table. "That damned Celio…ruined everything."

Bettina leaned forward, her eyes gleaming with false interest. "Tell me about it."

"What's it to you?" He grumbled suspiciously.

"Maybe…" Bettina said slowly, letting the thought hang in the air, "Maybe I can help."

Bettina watched Vorlag carefully. She needed him to trust her, or at least trust her enough to open his mouth. "Maybe I have information that could…ease your pain. Information about Celio. Information that others might pay dearly for."

Vorlag squinted, his eyes momentarily sharpening. "What kind of information?"

Bettina smiled enigmatically. "The kind that reveals cracks in a foundation. The kind that shows where the money is really flowing. The kind that proves not everyone is happy with Celio's… unique business practices."

She paused, letting her words sink in. The blood magic she'd learned from the Ashwood witches thrummed faintly beneath her skin. Just a touch, barely noticeable, enough to make him a little more agreeable, a little more trusting. Nothing overt. Just a subtle nudge.

Vorlag hesitated, swirling the dregs of his drink. "There are… whispers," he said finally, his voice barely above a whisper. "Talk of a faction within the Merchant Guild. Merchants who believe Celio is favoring draconian interests. That she’s giving them unfair advantages, bleeding human businesses dry."

*Draconian interests,* Bettina thought, a cold feeling settling in her stomach. That could complicate things significantly. If Alli was truly prioritizing dragons over humans, then this wasn't just about trade routes and profits. This was about power, about allegiances, about something much bigger and far more dangerous.

"And these…whispers," she pressed, keeping her voice gentle and encouraging. "Are they just whispers, or is there substance to them?"

Vorlag took another swig, seemingly gaining confidence. "Substance. Meetings held in secret. Coded messages. I even heard someone mention a list. A list of merchants who've lost everything because of Celio’s deals.” He glanced around nervously, then leaned closer. “I also overheard that there was a… a ‘leak’ somewhere. Someone within their ranks leaked information. I overheard the rumor because… well… I've been known to do a little information brokering in my time as well, mostly for fun."

Bettina resisted the urge to press him further about the leak. One thread at a time. "And who is leading this… faction?" she asked.

Vorlag shook his head. "No one knows for sure. They're careful. Shadowy figures. But the sentiment is real. I felt the fire burn. Believe me, I’m someone who would know, now."

"So what do you need me for, exactly?" he asked, a flicker of suspicion returning to his eyes. "Why are you sharing information instead of selling it?"

Bettina shrugged nonchalantly. "Maybe I'm just tired of seeing good people get trampled. Maybe I have my own reasons for wanting to see Celio taken down a peg. Maybe… I see an opportunity for a mutually beneficial arrangement."

She met his gaze, letting the challenge hang in the air. She needed to gauge his ambition, his willingness to act. "What happened after Celio stole your contract?"

Vorlag visibly bristled. "What *didn't* happen? I tried to fight back, of course. Filed complaints with the Guild, contacted lawyers. But Celio's got connections. Powerful connections. Every door slammed shut in my face." He swallowed hard, his face flushed with anger. "I lost everything. My business, my reputation, my home. I’m…well, let's just say that if someone gave me the opportunity to put Celio out of business permanently, I wouldn’t hesitate."

Bettina nodded slowly. This was promising. He had the motive, the resentment, and potentially the connections. He wasn’t just whispering into his ale; he still had some fire in him. Now she just needed to find a way to use it.

"Tell me more about these coded messages," she said, changing the subject slightly. "What did you hear?"

Vorlag hesitated, his eyes darting around the alleyway again. He seemed scared, but also strangely excited. "The message, I hear, details an imminent shipment of draconic goods, an enormous deal, for the purpose of outfitting a draconic outpost on the Dragon Coast, where they are taking a loss due to shipping costs that Celio said she was going to assist with but, evidently, they are getting absolutely nothing in return from this shipment"

Bettina filed away the new detail. This could prove to be very important. If they could find this message, and then find proof that it was being ignored, it could incite fury from the Draconic families. "You wouldn’t happen to know anything about the location of said meeting would you?"

Vorlag let out a weak cough. "I believe some parties would be interested in some more… information"
Bettina, unfazed at Vorlag asking for a transaction, took out two gold coins. "And I will happily assist." She pushed the two gold coins into Vorlags shirt pocket, where they landed with a solid thud.

"Well now," Vorlag spoke, "That meeting should be coming soon. Tonight actually… The Whispering Coin. Around… I don’t know, 10? Don't hold me to it now."

The coins would barely scratch the surface of Vorlags debt. But it will push him in the right direction.

"Thank you, Vorlag. You have helped me very much." She gave a warm smile, then quickly left the alleyway.

*Tonight at The Whispering Coin.*

Bettina ran back into the bar to get some new information, but as she entered the entrance, she ran into an unwelcome figure.

"Martie? What are you doing here?"

Bettina ran back into the bar to get some new information, but as she entered the entrance, she ran into an unwelcome figure.

"Martie? What are you doing here?"

Martie, ever the composed professional, raised a perfectly sculpted eyebrow. "And good evening to you too, Bettina. One might think you'd be pleased to see a friend."

“This is a pretty low place to make a 'friendly' meet" Bettina replied, her voice barely containing her suspicions. "Also what do you want?"

Martie gave a low hum of contemplation. "You know that whole blackmail situation, you're *ever* so deeply involved with? What did you find?"

Bettina stiffened. So Martie already knew. Of course, she did; very little happened in Porthaven that Martie wasn’t at least aware of. She wouldn't give her everything, especially in this place.

"I met a friend who confirmed some… things." Bettina replied evasively, glancing around the bar. This conversation needed to happen elsewhere. "Come on. We’ll talk at your place."

Martie arched her eyebrow again. "Very well."

The walk back to Martie’s workshop was short, but filled with a pregnant silence. Bettina could practically feel Martie’s calculating gaze boring into the back of her head. The air practically crackled with unspoken questions and potential bargains.

Once inside the familiar clutter of clockwork gears and half-finished automatons, Bettina finally relaxed, slightly. She dropped into a well-worn armchair while Martie busied herself behind her workbench, fiddling with a small, intricate device.

"So," Martie said, without turning around. "You blackmailed Celio." It wasn’t a question.

Bettina sighed. “Is that such a surprise?”

“Not particularly," Martie conceded, placing the device down gently. "You’re impulsive, and you have a talent for seeing opportunities where others see only risk. But blackmailing one of the most powerful merchants in Porthaven? That’s a bold move, even for you.

“I’m employed by her now, looking into who gave up her coded message to begin with." Bettina smirked. "A perfect position to see if she is siphoning from trade routes."

Martie turned to face her, her eyes gleaming with a mixture of amusement and curiosity. “And I assume that’s where I come in?”

Bettina nodded. “I need credentials, access to restricted areas. Preferably something that will let me waltz into a private meeting without raising too many eyebrows.”

Martie leaned back against her workbench, considering. "And what exactly did you uncover that was so 'helpful' to Celio?"

Bettina debated how much to reveal. Martie was an ally, of sorts, but she was also fiercely independent and driven by her own ambitions. She couldn’t afford to give her too much leverage.

"The gist of it is this: Someone within the consortiums leaked information about Celio's trade routes," Bettina finally said. "And I’m supposed to find out who. They're meeting tonight. So hopefully I can find them."

Martie steepled her fingers, her expression thoughtful. “An inside job, you say? Interesting.” A slow smile spread across her face. “Well, I do have a few… connections. And a talent for crafting convincing documents. Give me the specifics. What kind of credentials do you need?”

Bettina detailed her requirements: A membership card, a letter of introduction from a respected merchant, and, ideally, a pass that would grant her access to secure warehouses.

Martie listened intently, occasionally interjecting with questions. When Bettina finished, she nodded slowly. “I can do that. But it will cost you.”

Bettina smirked. “Everything does with you, Martie.”

“Indeed. But this is more than just a simple forgery. This is providing you with access to potentially dangerous information. This is about changing the balance of power in Porthaven. I want access to that draconic shipping information you mentioned. I have associates… friends… that would be very interested in it"

Bettina didn’t hesitate. “You got it. I get the credentials, you get the shipping list.” She watched Martie's face carefully. Martie’s mind was already spinning. She was seeing the potential profit and the power that came with it.

"Very well," Martie said, snapping her fingers. "I'll get to work immediately. Come back in a few hours."

As Bettina turned to leave, Martie added, "Oh, and Bettina? Be careful. This game you’re playing is far more dangerous than you realize. Celio isn't the only one with secrets, or the only one willing to protect them."

Bettina glanced back, a flicker of unease in her eyes. She knew Martie was right. But she was already in too deep to turn back. And, she had to admit, she was starting to enjoy the game.

"I always am." Bettina muttered under her breath.

Bettina smoothed the fabric of her borrowed merchant’s coat, adjusting the ill-fitting collar. Martie had outdone herself. The credentials felt solid, looked authentic, and even smelled faintly of old parchment and trade spices. Impressive, even for Martie. The small forger had been right to charge for her services; this access wasn't cheap.

Taking a deep breath, Bettina presented her documents to the guard standing sentinel at the entrance of the Merchant Guild Hall's opulent meeting room. He scrutinized the letter of introduction, his eyes narrowing suspiciously. Bettina held her breath, forcing herself to meet his gaze with a neutral expression. She was banking on the assumption that no one knew the credentials were fake. This level of access had to look believable if she were to fool people.

Finally, with a grunt, the guard waved her through. "Take a seat along the back wall, Merchant Velsa. The meeting will begin shortly."

"Thank you," Bettina said, offering a polite nod as she moved into the crowded hall. "Merchant Velsa" was apparently a specialist in imported silks and tapestries, judging by the forged letterhead. Bettina wouldn't have known what to say had someone addressed her directly regarding that specialization. It was for that reason she quickly claimed a seat as far from the other attendees as possible.

The room was a study in controlled opulence. Rich tapestries depicting scenes of trade and prosperity adorned the walls. Crystal chandeliers cast a warm glow on the faces of the assembled merchants, each a pillar of Porthaven society. The air hummed with hushed conversations, the clinking of goblets, and the rustle of fine fabrics.

Bettina scanned the room, observing the power dynamics at play. There was Old Man Tiberius, a gruff veteran with a fortune built on the iron trade, speaking with an obsequious young man who wore a flashy suit and carried himself with the air of a newly minted nobleman. And then there was Seraphina, her rival in the thieving world, who was in conversation with another merchant and subtly displaying an amethyst ring that probably cost more than Bettina's entire room at the tavern. It was not a ring she remembered having seen before.

Tension was a thick, almost tangible thing in the room. Bettina could practically taste it. Good. It meant that what Martie had uncovered was real. Celio's competitors were circling.

As the room quieted, a portly man with a booming voice stepped forward. "Honored merchants," he announced, "let us begin. Tonight's discussion concerns matters of utmost importance to the economic stability of our fair city. Specifically, the recent disruptions to trade routes instigated by the... unconventional practices of certain individuals."

Bettina leaned forward, her senses on high alert. Here it comes. The first jab at Celio.

"I speak, of course," the portly man continued, his gaze sweeping the room, "of the draconian trade agreement brokered by Alli Celio. An agreement that, in the opinion of many, unfairly favors draconic interests over those of human merchants."

A murmur of agreement rippled through the crowd. Bettina subtly activated a simple blood magic ritual, enhancing her hearing. She needed to catch every word.

"My warehouses are overflowing with cheap scales from across the sea, and I am quickly losing profits because of it!" Someone said, breaking the illusion of proper etiquette.

"Our businesses were built on a balanced market," a woman’s voice chimed in, laced with disdain. "Not on appeasing fire-breathing lizards!"

Bettina’s eyes narrowed. These were the voices of dissent, the ones who felt wronged by Celio. And likely, the ones who had leaked the coded message. She needed to identify the source, the one who had the guts to betray her boss.

The portly man raised his hands for silence. "While I understand your concerns, I urge you to remain calm. We must proceed with caution. Accusations without proof are meaningless."

"Then let us discuss the coded message!" Someone shouted from the back of the room.

Bingo.

"There were whispers that a certain individual had acquired a replica shield. And it seems it was being used to find weaknesses with the council" Another merchant called from his chair.

"Yes! And let us not forget that Alli Celio herself used that as a point of recruitment for a spy herself," a voice called from across the room.

"Silence!" The portly man banged a gavel against the table. "This meeting is adjourned. We will continue this discussion at a later date, when emotions are not so...inflamed.
"

The room erupted in a cacophony of voices. Bettina watched as the merchants began to disperse, their faces flushed with anger and frustration. She had learned enough. The factions were clear, the tension palpable. But she still needed a name, a face to pin on the betrayal.
As she began to navigate her way through the throng of people, she recognized someone she knew, and froze in her tracks. The person called out her name, but she acted as if she did not hear.
Bettina began to look around, seeking an exit away from the approaching voice, as if the meeting was too boring for her to stay. This was information she would need to give to Celio if she were to retain her role as investigator.
But why was Seraphina at the meeting? It couldn't be to cause trouble, could it? Perhaps Seraphina was in Celio's pocket as well, and had been assigned to keep tabs on the others, just like Bettina. Perhaps she was there for something more… sinister.

Cristionna sighed, the weight of the High Council pressing down on her shoulders. The evening air in her chambers was thick with the scent of incense, a feeble attempt to mask the underlying tension that had become a constant companion. She stared out the window at Porthaven, its twinkling lights a deceptive mask for the darkness she knew lurked beneath.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. "Enter," she said, her voice weary.

Her attendant, a young woman named Elara, curtsied and presented her with a small, sealed scroll. "A message arrived, Councilor. It was delivered by a… less-than-reputable source." Elara’s nose wrinkled slightly, betraying her disapproval.

Cristionna took the scroll, her fingers tracing the unfamiliar sigil on the wax. "Thank you, Elara. You are dismissed."

Elara hesitated. "Is there anything else I can do, Councilor?"

Cristionna forced a smile. "No, Elara. I simply require some time for contemplation." A half-truth, but necessary. She couldn't afford witnesses to what she was about to read.

Elara nodded and retreated, closing the door softly behind her. Cristionna waited until the sound of her footsteps faded before breaking the seal. Inside was a single sheet of parchment covered in a crude cipher – a far cry from the elegant script she was accustomed to. Her heart sank. This was from one of her contacts in the underbelly of the city, a network she cultivated carefully to stay ahead of the currents swirling beneath Porthaven's polished surface.

She quickly deciphered the message, her blood turning to ice as she read:

*Council Factions Mobilizing. Celio Agreement Under Fire. Possible Conspiracy Against Celio Sanctioned. Expect Instability.*

Cristionna crumpled the parchment in her fist. Conspiracy? Against Alli? This was worse than she had imagined. The delicate balance of power in Porthaven was already strained. If a concerted effort was being made to unseat Celio, the resulting power vacuum could plunge the city into chaos.

Celio's draconic trade agreement was indeed a contentious issue. Many human merchants felt unfairly disadvantaged, resentful of the resources and influence Celio wielded. But a conspiracy? That implied a coordinated effort, a deliberate attempt to destabilize the existing order. And if Celio fell, who would take her place? Someone far less… amenable to maintaining peace between humans and dragons, perhaps?

She paced her chambers, her mind racing. This wasn’t just about trade agreements or hurt feelings. This was about the very foundation of Porthaven. The alliance between humans and dragons, forged generations ago, was the bedrock of their prosperity and security. If that alliance crumbled, the consequences would be catastrophic.

She stopped at the window again, her gaze hardening as she surveyed the city below. She had a responsibility, not just as a Councilor, but as a protector of Porthaven. She had to find out who was behind this conspiracy and stop them before it was too late. But how?

She couldn't openly support Celio without risking exposing her own clandestine network and potentially escalating the conflict. Openly declaring for Celio would place a target upon her back, and she wasn't in the position to play that game quite yet. She needed more information, a clearer understanding of the players involved and their motivations.

Her thoughts drifted to Bettina. The young woman had proven resourceful and cunning, capable of navigating the murky depths of Porthaven’s underworld. Celio has mentioned taking her in to investigate the leak. Maybe, just maybe, Bettina was the key to uncovering the truth. But how could she contact her without raising suspicion?

Cristionna took a deep breath, attempting to clear her head. This situation demanded careful consideration, a delicate balancing act between action and discretion. She couldn’t afford to make a mistake.

"Elara!" she called, her voice regaining its usual composure.

A moment later, Elara appeared at the doorway. "Yes, Councilor?"

"I require a message delivered. To a… mutual acquaintance. Discreetly." Cristionna paused, choosing her words carefully. "Tell her... the scales are tipping. She will understand."

Bettina slipped through the shadows, a ghost in the grand hall of the Merchant Guild. The opulence felt suffocating – polished mahogany, velvet drapes, and the pervasive scent of old money mixed with expensive perfume. This wasn't her world. Her world was the alleyways and back doors, the whispers and the grime. But tonight, her worlds were colliding.

Martie's forged credentials, tucked securely in her boot, were working their magic. A distracted, overweight guard had barely glanced at the document before waving her through with a grunt. Now, she stood before the imposing oak door of the archive room, the final barrier between her and the information she craved.

Bettina pressed her ear to the door, listening. Silence. Perfect.

A flick of her wrist and a thin, almost invisible wire extended from a hidden compartment in her sleeve. Years spent honing her craft in the seediest corners of the city had made her a master of locks, no matter how intricate. The tumblers clicked softly, betraying nothing, and the door swung inward with a barely audible sigh.

The archive room was a labyrinth of towering shelves, packed with dusty ledgers, bound documents, and forgotten secrets. The air hung heavy with the scent of aged paper and ink, a smell that both repulsed and intrigued her. It smelled of the past, a past she needed to understand if she wanted to navigate the present.

"Alright, focus," she murmured to herself, pulling a small lantern from her pack. The soft glow illuminated the first few rows of shelves. “Alli’s deals with the dragons…”

She began her search, systematically scanning the titles of each document. Years of trade agreements, disputes, and financial records blurred together in a monotonous stream. Bettina resisted the urge to skim, knowing the devil was always in the details.

Hours passed, marked only by the dwindling light of her lantern and the growing ache in her muscles. She found references to numerous deals between human merchants and various dragon clans, but nothing that specifically implicated Alli Celio. Doubts began to creep in. Was she chasing a ghost? Was Alli right? Were they manipulating her?

"Grimbold Stonehand…" she muttered, running a finger down a particularly long list of names on a shipping manifest. He’d handled a *lot* of product and coin, that was evident.

A sudden noise – a faint scratching sound – sent her heart leaping into her throat. She doused the lantern, plunging the room into darkness. Holding her breath, she pressed herself against a nearby shelf, listening intently. The scratching continued, closer now, accompanied by a soft rustling.

Rats. Probably just rats.

She chided herself for her paranoia. Celio’s warning about being watched had clearly gotten to her. But the scratching persisted, and with it, a growing sense of unease. It was too rhythmic, too deliberate to be the random movements of rodents.

Bettina slowly reached for the dagger concealed beneath her cloak. She moved silently, her senses on high alert, weaving between the shelves until she pinpointed the source of the noise.

A figure huddled near a far corner, a hooded man bent over a small, locked chest. He seemed oblivious to her presence, his full attention focused on picking the lock with a set of delicate tools.

Bettina watched him for a moment, a silent observer in the darkness. This wasn’t a rat. This was a rat catcher… of a different sort.

She raised her dagger, her mind racing. Was this someone else searching for information related to Alli Celio? Was this another player in the game she'd unwittingly joined? Or was it someone else entirely?

"Looking for something?" she asked, her voice barely a whisper, yet sharp enough to cut through the silence.

The hooded figure froze, his body tensing. He slowly turned to face her, his face obscured by shadows.

"Who's there?" he rasped, his voice low and gravelly.

Bettina stepped into the dim light filtering in through a high window, her dagger glinting in her hand. "Just a curious observer. What’s in the chest?" she pressed, “Something you shouldn’t have, I’d reckon.”

Bettina watched him, her mind already running through possibilities. This could be a chance encounter, a simple thief looking for a quick score. Or… it could be much more. Another player in Alli’s tangled web. A pawn, or perhaps a rival.

“That’s… none of your concern,” the man finally replied, his voice betraying a hint of nervousness. He made a slight move towards a nearby bookshelf, as if considering an escape route.

"Everything is my concern, nowadays," Bettina countered, taking another step closer. “Especially when I find people breaking into places where they don’t belong. Places where I’m trying to work." She emphasized the last few words, subtly implying that she had a right to be there, a position of authority.

The man hesitated, his gaze flicking between Bettina's dagger and her face. He clearly wasn't expecting to be interrupted, much less challenged.

"I'm just… looking for some old documents," he mumbled, his voice unconvincing. "Historical research, you understand."

Bettina scoffed. "Historical research that requires lockpicks? I'm not stupid. Now, tell me what's in the chest." She lowered her dagger slightly, but kept it trained on him. “Or better yet, just hand it over. I hate a mess, and I can’t be held responsible if there’s an *accident*.”

He swallowed hard, the sound amplified in the stillness of the room. “Alright, alright. No need for violence. I’m… I’m a collector. Of information.” He gestured weakly at the chest. “This contains certain… financial records that are of interest to me.”

"Financial records, huh? Related to Alli Celio, perhaps?" Bettina prodded, watching his reaction closely. She could see a flicker of surprise in his eyes, quickly masked by a carefully constructed mask of neutrality.

"I don't know who you're talking about," he said, a little too quickly.

Bettina didn't believe him for a second. "Look, I’m on a tight schedule and you’re eating into my time. You're wasting both of our time. So how about this: you tell me who you are, who you're working for, and what you’re looking for, and maybe I’ll let you walk out of here in one piece." She leaned in closer, her eyes narrowing. "Lie to me, and you'll regret it."

The man sighed, his shoulders slumping in defeat. "My name is Elmsworth. I used to be an accountant for the Merchant Consortium. Until they… let me go." Bitterness laced his voice.

“Fired, you mean?”

He gave a curt nod. “They said I was… ‘unreliable.’ I asked too many questions. I saw things I shouldn’t have seen." He glanced at the chest. "This is proof of their… *shadier* dealings. Their dragon deals. And more specifically, how Celio uses those deals to personally benefit.”

"And you were planning to… expose them?" Bettina asked, genuinely curious.

Elmsworth laughed, a short, humorless sound. "Expose them? To whom? The city guard, who are probably on their payroll? I had plans to… leverage them. A little financial… compensation for my troubles. Enough to set me up somewhere far, far away from here. Safe."

Bettina considered his words. Elmsworth was clearly not a hardened criminal, just a disgruntled ex-employee looking for revenge. But his information could still be valuable.

"Did you hear of a leaked message?" she questioned. "A coded message mentioning Alli favoring Draconic interests?"

Elmsworth’s eyes widened slightly. “I did hear whispers… rumors. That's why I had to retrieve it! I believed it was this document that implicated everything and would give me the leverage I needed!"

"So, you're the source of the leak," Bettina mused, connecting the dots. "You sent that coded message. But to whom?"

"Not me, not exactly…" Elmsworth paused, seemingly choosing his words carefully. "I know who did send the message though. It was Faldren. Faldren Vayne. A merchant who lost a very lucrative trade deal because Alli suddenly favored a Draconic consortium instead.”

*Faldren Vayne*. Bettina filed the name away in her memory. The first solid lead since she had been roped into all this.

"Lost deal and burning resentment. This lines up..." she murmured. "And the Consortium?"

"They found out he was the leak. They have people everywhere." Elmsworth shivered. "Faldren has been in hiding since."

"He can't be in hiding if you found this chest and knew who sent the message!" Bettina responded, a little incredulous.

Elmsworth paused. "I just know bits of pieces. I overheard rumors from other members. It took me a while to track this chest here."

Bettina thought for a moment. "Alright, Elmsworth. Here's how it's going to work. You're going to tell me everything you know about Faldren Vayne, everything about this leak, and everything else you know about Alli's shady dealings. In detail.” She gestured to the chest with her dagger. “And then, maybe, I'll let you keep your little treasure. But if I find out you're holding back anything… well, let's just say I have ways of making people talk."

She watched his face, gauging his reaction. He was scared, desperate, and probably not very trustworthy. But he was also her best lead at the moment. The Drunken Dragon Inn would have to wait. She had a merchant to find.

“Okay… okay,” Elmsworth stammered, his eyes darting around nervously. “I’ll tell you everything. Just… just please, don’t hurt me.”

Bettina smiled, a predatory glint in her eyes. “That depends entirely on you.”

Bettina left Elmsworth tied up, gagged, and hidden behind a stack of crates; his future and life were dependent on how truthful he was. With Faldren Vayne's name echoing in her mind, Bettina turned her attention to Grimbold Stonehand's former office. The warehouse district was nearly deserted, the only sounds the creaking of aging timbers and the distant cries of gulls. The office itself was tucked away at the end of a narrow alleyway, its door scarred and weather-beaten, the wooden sign that likely bore Grimbold's name long gone.

"Right," Bettina muttered to herself, drawing a set of lockpicks from a pouch concealed beneath her coat. "Let's see what secrets Grimbold left behind."

The lock was old and simple, yielding to her practiced touch within seconds. The door creaked open, revealing a small, musty room. Dust motes danced in the dim light filtering through a grimy window. The air was thick with the scent of mildew and decay.

"Charming," Bettina said dryly, stepping inside. The room was sparsely furnished. A rickety wooden desk stood against one wall, its surface covered in a layer of dust. A couple of overturned chairs lay scattered about, and a few empty shelves lined the opposite wall. Clearly, this place hadn't been touched since Grimbold's hasty departure, except for the vagrants and rats.

Bettina surveyed the scene, her eyes scanning for anything of interest. She started with the desk, carefully sifting through the papers and debris. Most of it was useless: discarded invoices, crumpled receipts, and faded letters. But then, tucked away in a corner, she found a small, leather-bound ledger.

"Jackpot," she breathed, her fingers brushing off the dust. She opened the ledger, her eyes scanning the entries. Most were mundane records of transactions, but one entry caught her attention: a large sum of money paid to a 'D.V.' for 'services rendered'.

"D.V… Faldren Vayne?" Bettina wondered aloud. It seemed likely. The ledger offered no further clues, but Bettina was determined to find more. She ran her hand along the back of the desk, feeling for any hidden compartments or loose panels. Her fingers brushed against something unexpected, a slight indentation in the wood.

"Bingo," she grinned, applying pressure to the indentation. A small section of the desk slid open, revealing a hidden compartment. Inside lay another ledger, smaller and more discreet than the first. This one was bound in dark leather, its pages filled with meticulously kept records.

Bettina’s heart pounded as she opened it. The entries were coded, using a complex system of numbers and symbols. But as she deciphered the first few entries, the truth became chillingly clear. This was a record of Grimbold Stonehand’s illicit dealings with the Draconic consortiums. Details of trade routes, resource allocations, and… and here it was.

An entry detailing a lucrative trade deal, one that had been abruptly canceled by Alli Celio in favor of a dragon clan known as the 'Obsidian Claws'. The canceled deal was with *Faldren Vayne.*

Bettina scanned the entry, her mind racing. The numbers were staggering, a fortune lost to Faldren Vayne when Alli Celio had pulled the rug out from under him. "No wonder the man wanted revenge," she muttered. "That's enough to make anyone turn traitor."

Closing the ledger, she felt a surge of excitement, which quickly turned into a cold wave of caution. This ledger was solid proof. This revealed motive. This could be enough to bring Alli Celio down, but also to get Bettina killed. She closed the hidden compartment, placing the ledger carefully back inside. As she did, she noticed something peculiar: a faint, almost imperceptible scratch on the inside of the compartment.

She examined it closely, her fingers tracing the delicate line. It was the shape of a claw, or perhaps… a scale. "Interesting," she whispered. "Looks like someone else was here before me." Was Faldren Vayne searching for this? Had Celio? This find implied that Celio was more aware and cautious than Bettina imagined. And it warned of a bigger network of connections to monitor.

She glanced around the room again, a sense of unease settling over her. She didn’t like how this was all lining up. So much she knew, but far more that was hidden beneath the surface. Bettina knew this couldn't just be an isolated incident of revenge, and the scales had pointed to Faldren.

“Time to move on,” she whispered to herself, leaving the abandoned office as silently as she had arrived, and retraced her steps back to where she had left Elmsworth tied up. This time, she decided, she was going to let the man go. She no longer needed him.

Bettina materialized onto the rain-slicked rooftop, a favored perch offering a panoramic view of Porthaven's Merchant Quarter. The sprawling district pulsed with activity even at this late hour, lanterns casting a warm glow on bustling streets below. The wind whipped around her, carrying the scent of brine and spices—a familiar and comforting aroma, even as it carried with it the tang of deception.

She wrapped her arms around herself, a chill settling deep in her bones, deeper than the autumn air warranted. Grimbold Stonehand. The disgruntled merchant whose empire had been crippled by Alli Celio’s deal with the Obsidian Claws. It was all too convenient. Too clean.

But she couldn't deny the evidence. The coded message, the missing fortune, the claw mark in the hidden compartment. Everything pointed to Stonehand. The old human was driven by revenge. Revenge that could destroy Celio.

“Revenge and a thirst for profit,” she murmured, her voice barely audible above the city's hum. “Never underestimate the allure of coin, even to a man driven by spite.”

She paced the rooftop's edge, her mind piecing together the puzzle. Stonehand had the motive, and now she had him. But what to do with him? Hand him over to Celio? Expose his betrayal to the authorities? Neither option particularly appealed to her. Celio might reward her handsomely, but she'd become a mere pawn in her game. Revealing Stonehand's secrets would mean playing the Paladin's Order by their rules. Rules, she decided, were meant to be broken.

A cruel smile touched her lips. "Perhaps a bit of personal interrogation is in order," she mused. "See what other tasty secrets the old man is hiding."

She leaned against the weather-worn stone railing, letting her gaze drift over the Merchant Quarter below. A plan began to form in her mind, a delicate dance of manipulation and deception, one she hoped would lead her closer to the truth – and a sizable profit, of course.

“First, understand his resources,” she thought. “Then, see where he’s been spending his time since the message was leaked.”

Bettina knew approaching him directly would be a mistake. Stonehand was no fool; he would be wary, suspicious of any newcomers. She needed to be subtle, to insinuate herself into his world without raising alarms.

“I’ll have to get to his crew first," Bettina determined. "The information he’s been spreading had to come from somewhere.”

She paused, the name 'Faldren Vayne' surfacing in her thoughts. Vayne, the other victim of Celio’s treachery. The recipient of the canceled trade deal. Was he in league with Stonehand? Was he a pawn, or a player?

A new, colder wave settled over her. The scratch mark on Stonehand’s wall seemed to point the finger back at Vayne, and Vayne seemed deeply entrenched with the Dragon consortiums. But, Celio’s network of contacts had also dealt with Vayne. So why would Celio's network betray her now?

“So many threads," she muttered. "All tangled together.” She closed her eyes, trying to clear the confusion. She must remain logical. All of these plots would bring about more than just financial loss, and it was unlikely her draconic allies would be forgiving.

Taking a deep breath, she refocused on Stonehand. The key was to approach him indirectly, to find someone who could provide her with information without alerting him to her true intentions. Perhaps one of his business associates, or a disgruntled employee seeking revenge of their own. There were always loose lips in the Merchant Quarter, eager to spill secrets for the right price.

Her thoughts turned to Martie. Her unique blend of forgery and information brokerage would be invaluable in this endeavor. She could provide the necessary introductions, the forged credentials, and the discreet back channels needed to navigate the treacherous currents of the Merchant Quarter.

“Martie owes me that much, at least,” Bettina thought, a flicker of annoyance in her mind. She had essentially handed the forger a gold mine, a chance to prove her loyalty, and all Martie had offered in return were cryptic warnings and a frustratingly cautious approach.

She knew Martie was playing both sides, hedging her bets, but Bettina was confident she could steer her in the right direction—especially with the right incentive.

Bettina grinned. "A little more blackmail, perhaps?" she thought.

As the first rays of dawn kissed the horizon, painting the sky in hues of rose and gold, Bettina descended from the rooftop, a newfound sense of purpose hardening her resolve. The hunt was on. And she was determined to unearth every last secret buried within the heart of the Merchant Quarter, starting with Grimbold Stonehand. It was time to unravel this dangerous game. It was time to win.
