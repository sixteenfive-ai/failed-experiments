STORY SO FAR:
The story begins with Bettina uncovering a coded message concealed within a paladin shield. Recognizing the complexity of the cipher, she journeys to Porthaven in search of Martie, a renowned forger known for her exceptional skills.

Upon arriving in Porthaven, Bettina observes Martie at work, witnessing firsthand the forger's dexterity and artistry. Impressed, she approaches Martie with a proposition: to decipher the coded message hidden within the shield. Martie, ever pragmatic, agrees to assist Bettina, but not without a price. She requests payment for her services, instructing Bettina to bring the shield to her workshop the following evening.

As Bettina departs, Martie’s attention is diverted by the arrival of a noblewoman. The noblewoman seeks Martie's talents to create a flawless replica of a heavily warded music box, an heirloom of significant value. The prospect of such an intricate task intrigues Martie, and she accepts the commission. To inflate her payment, Martie feigns the need for extensive research into the box's construction, though she already possesses the necessary knowledge. Martie intends to pocket the extra coin for herself. With both commissions secured, Martie prepares to close her stall for the evening, her mind occupied by the satyr thief’s cryptic message, the noble's precious music box, and the knowledge that both will soon be subject to her expertise.

STORY SO FAR:
The story begins with Bettina's discovery of a coded message hidden within a paladin shield. Recognizing the complexity of the cipher, she seeks the expertise of Martie, a renowned forger in Porthaven.

Upon arriving in Porthaven, Bettina witnesses Martie's impressive skills firsthand. She approaches Martie with the shield, requesting her assistance in deciphering the coded message. Martie, always practical, agrees to help, demanding payment in return and instructing Bettina to bring the shield to her workshop the following evening.

As Bettina leaves, a noblewoman arrives, seeking Martie's talents to create a perfect replica of a heavily warded music box, a valuable family heirloom. Intrigued by the challenge, Martie accepts the commission. She subtly inflates the price by pretending to need extensive research, intending to pocket the extra money. With both commissions secured, Martie closes her stall, contemplating the satyr thief’s message, the noble's precious music box, and the work ahead.

The following evening, Bettina delivers the paladin shield to Martie's workshop. Martie confirms the presence of a coded message and begins the painstaking process of deciphering it. While Martie works, Bettina examines a forged Draconic trade agreement, suspecting Martie's involvement in potentially illegal activities.

With the plan set, Martie scrutinizes the list of transactions with a magnifying glass, both women settling in for the night, determined to expose Alli Celio's secrets.

STORY SO FAR:
The story begins with Bettina's discovery of a coded message hidden within a paladin shield. Seeking expertise, she enlists Martie, a renowned forger in Porthaven. Arriving in Porthaven, Bettina witnesses Martie's skills and requests her assistance, and Martie agrees for a price. Shortly after, a noblewoman commissions Martie to create a perfect replica of a heavily warded music box. With both commissions secured, Martie contemplates the tasks ahead.

Bettina delivers the paladin shield to Martie, who confirms the coded message and begins deciphering it. Bettina, suspecting Martie's involvement in illegal activities, examines a forged Draconic trade agreement. Their conversation reveals the shield's message points to Alli Celio as a manipulator of trade, potentially destabilizing the peace. They uncover Grimbold Stonehand's name on a transaction list, and decide to investigate Celio’s network and analyze her trade routes.

Their investigation uncovers questionable transactions within Grimbold Stonehand's ledger, indicating a larger scheme orchestrated by Alli Celio. Bettina pushes for blackmail, and despite Martie's reservations, convinces her of the potential reward. Bettina successfully blackmails Celio and is hired to discover who leaked the coded message. Celio tasks Tawnya with leading Bettina to the Grey Scales office to investigate trade routes, suspecting the merchant consortiums leaked Celio's coded message due to resentment over draconic trade agreements. At the Whispering Coin Tavern, Bettina encounters Vorlag, a disgruntled merchant. She infiltrates the Merchant Guild's meeting, discovering widespread discontent, and breaks into the Merchant Guild archives, finding Elmsworth, a former accountant who uncovered an illicit trade deal led by Faldren Vayne. Searching his old office, she finds Grimbold Stonehand's ledger, directly linking him to the suspicious trade deals and implicating Vayne. Disguised as a tax auditor, Bettina gains entry into Grimbold Stonehand's residence, questioning him and uncovering another coded message, a ledger detailing political names, and a counterfeit paladin shield. Overhearing Vayne and other merchants plotting against Celio, Bettina reports her findings to Martie. Cristionna, already aware of a coded message, interrogates Vayne and confirms his conspiracy against Alli Celio. Celio and Tawnya review the Merchant Guild Archives, discovering coded messages proving Vayne is underreporting finances and funneling money to organizations seeking to dismantle the dragon alliance. Alli tasks Tawnya with gathering intelligence from the underworld.

Bettina dispatches an urgent message to Alli Celio, exposing the merchant consortium's plans to sabotage an impending draconic shipment and presenting further evidence of their conspiracy. Alli, confirming the plot, confronts the merchant consortiums, leading to Vayne and Stonehand confessing their treachery. Consequently, Alli places all merchants under strict surveillance and demands compensation. Tawnya's underworld contacts reveal whispers of new leadership and unfolding plots, prompting Alli to intensify her surveillance on Martie, suspecting potential betrayal. Alli intends to manipulate Bettina as a pawn.

Alli confirms Vayne and Stonehand's betrayal. Alli and Tawnya discuss Bettina's possible motives, questioning her trustworthiness, while planning to monitor Martie, who may be playing both sides. Alli decides to let Bettina think she's in control, manipulating events to reinforce her own power, including rumors of Vayne and Stonehand's "accidents." Martie suggests Bettina leverage her new position to demand a position within Skyreach itself, highlighting how Celio may try to pin deeds on her. Bettina agrees to Martie's plan. Summoned to Skyreach, Bettina negotiates increased compensation, resources, and autonomy from Alli in exchange for ongoing intelligence. Alli accepts, but warns of close monitoring, tasking Bettina with finding who leaked the original coded message. Bettina, believing she is now in a good position with Skyreach, anticipates a future of prosperity.
