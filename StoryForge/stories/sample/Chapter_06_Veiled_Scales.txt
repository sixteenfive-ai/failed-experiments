Bettina swirled the amber liquid in her glass, the dim light of the Whispering Coin reflecting off its surface. *Chamomile and honey. Calming,* she thought, though her mind felt anything but. The chaotic jumble of information threatened to overwhelm her. Coded messages, illicit ledgers, and conspiratorial whispers buzzed around her skull like angry wasps.

Grimbold Stonehand, Faldren Vayne, and now, the unsettling realization of how far the rot had spread. A network of resentment and greed, all carefully cultivated, all aimed at Alli Celio. And worse, aimed at disrupting the fragile peace they were so desperate to maintain.

“Another, miss?” The barkeep, a stout man with a perpetually weary expression, gestured with a rag.

“Please,” Bettina murmured, pushing the empty glass forward. She needed to clear her head. Each sip of tea became an anchor, grounding her in the present.

The second cup arrived, steaming gently. Bettina closed her eyes, inhaling the soothing scent. She needed to organize her thoughts. First, the facts. Stonehand was Vayne’s lackey, laundering funds and providing a safe house for clandestine meetings. Vayne, fueled by the loss of his spice empire, was pulling the strings, funding rebels and spreading dissent. The politicians listed in Stonehand's ledger were… the unknown variable. Their allegiances, motivations, and potential involvement were still murky. *That's for Martie to decipher,* she reminded herself.

But the most immediate threat… The overheard conversation. Their intent was clearly to disrupt an upcoming shipment of draconic goods coming to port. Was the target to damage goods, inciting anger within the draconic community? Or worse, were they planning to… assassinate someone?

She shivered, despite the tavern’s warmth. The stakes were escalating rapidly. What had started as a simple blackmail opportunity was morphing into something far more dangerous, something that could shatter the uneasy truce between humans and dragons.

Bettina felt the familiar pang of guilt nibble at her conscience. Had her initial greed blinded her to the bigger picture? *No. I can use this.* She reminded herself that she can use the merchant’s desperation to her advantage and earn coin while stopping them. *Focus, Bettina. Focus on the information. Focus on the delivery of said information, to the right people.*

The 'right people', of course, was a delicate question. Alli Celio was her employer, for now. But Alli was also… compromised. The Grey Scales, for all its resources, had been chasing shadows, manipulated by Vayne and Stonehand. Cristionna, while seemingly incorruptible, might be too tied to protocol to act decisively.

And Martie… Bettina frowned. Martie was becoming a valuable asset, her knowledge of the city's underbelly and her connections were invaluable. Yet, she remained an enigma. An 'information hub', as Martie had called herself, she’d proven loyal to Celio, however she still danced with the merchant consortiums.

Bettina pushed the thought aside. *No time for doubts. Information first. Celio will act upon it, even if she sends Tawnya to investigate a false lead.* It was a gamble, but one she had to take.

She pulled out a small notepad from her satchel and began to jot down the key points, using a simple cipher to avoid attracting unwanted attention.

1.  Upcoming Draconic shipment - possible disruption.
2.  Vayne & Stonehand directly involved.
3.  Politicians (ledger) – Martie to investigate.
4.  Confirm Target – damage to shipment? Assassination?

Bettina paused, tapping the quill against the table. The coded message she had lifted from Stonehand's lavatory rested securely inside her coat. As Martie had explained:

"Remember the Gryphon on the first shield, Bettina? It symbolizes nobility, yes, but also vigilance. You can never be too careful in Porthaven," Martie had warned.

It’s was up to Martie to decode. Hopefully, it would hold further clues, maybe even the names of the politicians involved.

A chill ran down Bettina’s spine. Was she diving too deep? Was this conspiracy bigger than she imagined? *It's like Stonehand said: It's better to light one candle than to curse the darkness. Let us light the way.*

She downed the last of her tea and stood, the chair scraping against the wooden floor. Time to deliver her message. She had a feeling that the peace in Porthaven was about to be tested. And Bettina, for better or worse, was now right in the center of it all.

Bettina stepped out of the Whispering Coin and into the bustling Porthaven street, the salty air a stark contrast to the tavern’s smoky interior. Her destination: the Skyreach Messenger Station. Skyreach couriers employed trained Rocs to relay urgent messages to other large settlements. They were swift, discreet, and expensive - just what she needed.

The Messenger Station was a hub of organized chaos. Clerks shouted names and destinations, pages darted between rows of pigeonholes overflowing with scrolls, and the air buzzed with the impatient energy of those who needed their messages delivered yesterday. Bettina approached the counter, pushing past a gaggle of merchants arguing over shipping rates.

"Urgent dispatch," she stated, placing her sealed scroll on the counter. "Addressee: Alli Celio, Grey Scales Headquarters. Priority: immediate."

The clerk, a young man with ink-stained fingers and perpetually weary eyes, barely glanced at her. "Name?"

"Bettina." She kept it simple, no need to use the alias Martie forged for her to enter the Merchant’s Guild. "No return address required."

The clerk scribbled something on the scroll. "Skyreach delivery, immediate… right. That'll be fifteen sovereigns."

Bettina paid without argument. Fifteen sovereigns was a steep price, but the urgency warranted it. She watched as the clerk attached a small tag to the scroll and tossed it into a designated basket. "When will it arrive?" she asked.

"Under normal circumstances, within the day," the clerk replied, already turning to the next customer.

"And… these aren’t normal circumstances, are they?" Bettina pressed, her unease growing.

The clerk sighed, finally giving her a proper look. "Recent storms have thrown the Skyreach routes into disarray. The coastal winds are fierce, and several Rocs have been grounded. It's… congested up there. Highly irregular."

"Congested? You mean… my message might be delayed?" Bettina’s heart sank. Time was of the essence. Every moment Alli remained unaware of the merchants' plans, the closer those plans came to fruition.

The clerk shrugged. "Potentially. We're doing our best, miss. But nature doesn't care about deadlines. Best I can say is that your message will be sent out with the next available Roc heading that way. I’ll be sure to emphasize *urgent* on the label. You can come back later if you’d like, but it will cost another two sovereigns for an update, as there’s bound to be many inquiries by then."

Bettina felt a wave of frustration wash over her. "How long of a delay are we talking about? Hours? Days?"

"Impossible to say for sure, miss." The clerk’s tone was apologetic but firm. "Could be a few hours. Could be longer. Depends on the weather. Depends on the bird. If it is grounded at one of the relay stations, it could add to the delay."

Days… the thought was sickening. The merchants could be launching their attack even before Alli received the warning. She ran a hand through her hair, trying to formulate a plan. Could she travel to Grey Scales headquarters and deliver the message herself? No. Too risky. It would raise suspicion, and she couldn’t afford to blow her cover.

"Damn it," she muttered under her breath.

"Was there anything else, miss?" The clerk’s tone suggested he wanted her to leave.

Bettina considered her options. "Is there any way to… expedite the process? Perhaps offer an… incentive to the Roc handler?" She tried a charming smile, a skill she’d honed over years of dealing with unscrupulous merchants.

The clerk raised an eyebrow. "Bribery? You're suggesting I engage in illegal activity within the Skyreach Messenger Station? I am shocked, miss. *Shocked* I say." He paused, glancing around to make sure no one was listening. "Though I will admit… extra coin *can* encourage certain… accommodations." He lowered his voice further. "Twenty sovereigns. And I can guarantee your message will be placed on the wings of our fastest Roc heading to Grey Scales. No questions asked."

Bettina hesitated. Twenty more sovereigns… it was a significant sum. But the potential consequences of a delayed message far outweighed the cost. And Martie could probably pay it back. "Very well," she said, reluctantly pulling out another handful of coins. "Twenty sovereigns. Ensure my message gets through. And tell the handler… lives depend on it."

The clerk’s eyes gleamed as he pocketed the coins. "Consider it done, miss. May the winds be in your favor."

Bettina left the Skyreach Messenger Station, feeling only marginally better. The money was spent, and the message was presumably on its way. However, there was nothing else she could do. All she could do was wait. Would her warning arrive in time? Or would the merchants’ plot unfold before Alli could react, plunging Porthaven into chaos? It was a question that lingered heavily as she retraced her steps back towards the Whispering Coin, and the unknown.

Alli traced a gloved finger along the petals of a vibrant bluebell, her brow furrowed in thought. The Celio Estate gardens were a sanctuary of manicured beauty, a stark contrast to the storm brewing within her mind. Sunlight dappled through the leaves, painting shifting patterns on the manicured lawns.

"They think they're so clever, hiding behind coded messages and clandestine meetings," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Faldren Vayne… Grimbold Stonehand… a cabal of merchants clinging to outdated traditions, blinded by greed and resentment. All orchestrated by coded messages?"

Tawnya, ever vigilant, scanned the surrounding foliage, her hand resting near the hilt of her greatsword. "Cleverness and greed rarely go hand-in-hand, my Lady. Their actions reek of desperation. But is the destabilization worth starting an open conflict with the other consortiums? Are we sure they can fund any of these attacks that Bettina is speaking of?"

"Apparently so, Tawnya, unless our little information broker is selling me sand," Alli responded, then sighed. "But I trust Cristionna implicitly. Which means the rot is spreading faster than I anticipated. A few rogue merchants I could handle. But if they're actively funding rebels, stirring up discontent amongst the populace…that's a different game entirely."

She plucked a dead leaf from a nearby rose bush, crushing it between her fingers. "They underestimate the draconic alliance. They see it as a threat to their profits, a disruption of the old order. But they fail to see the stability, the prosperity, it brings to Porthaven. They would risk everything for a few more coins in their coffers."

"It is their nature, my Lady. Merchants hoard," Tawnya said, her voice neutral. "But perhaps…a proactive approach is in order. Instead of waiting for them to strike, strike first. Show them the consequences of their actions."

Alli stopped walking, turning to face Tawnya. "A direct confrontation? You suggest I go after the merchant consortiums? Publicly accuse them of treason?"

"Not accuse, my Lady. Demonstrate," Tawnya said, her gaze unwavering. "A show of force. A reminder of your authority. Let them understand that any attack on the draconic alliance is an attack on you."

Alli considered the idea, her mind racing. It was a risky gambit. It could backfire, pushing the merchants further into rebellion. But if she acted decisively, with strength and conviction, she might be able to nip the conspiracy in the bud before it blossomed into a full-blown conflict.

"The coded messages… that's the key, isn't it?" Alli murmured, more to herself than to Tawnya. "Bettina said she found another. Grimbold's."

"Which could tie directly to Vayne or another member of the consortiums," Tawnya added.

Alli nodded. "It's a thread. A loose end we can pull to unravel the entire conspiracy. But we need irrefutable proof." She began pacing again, her mind consumed by the logistics of such a confrontation. "I’d need to ensure the support of the High Council. I can’t act unilaterally; it would only fuel the flames of dissent."

"Cristionna already suspects Vayne is involved," Tawnya reminded her. "She may be willing to offer her backing."

Alli paused, a new thought dawning on her. "Vorlag," she said. "Cristionna also mentioned him. The merchant who lost his spice contract to a draconic deal… he has motive. Find out everything you can about Vorlag's dealings. His associates, his finances… anything that might link him to Vayne or Stonehand."

"It will be done, my Lady," Tawnya said, her tone businesslike. "And what of Bettina? Can we trust her with such sensitive information? She’s proven resourceful, but her motivations remain… ambiguous."

Alli sighed. "Ambiguous indeed. But she's also proven valuable. And she's already neck-deep in this mess. Besides…I have a feeling she enjoys playing both sides. It keeps things interesting for her. Besides," Alli added, a flicker of a smile playing on her lips, "I want to see just how far she's willing to go."

"A dangerous game, my Lady," Tawnya warned.

"Indeed," Alli agreed, her gaze hardening. "But sometimes, the most dangerous games are the only ones worth playing. Prepare the carriage, Tawnya. I have a High Council to persuade, and a merchant consortium to intimidate."

The sun, now higher in the sky, cast long shadows across the manicured lawns of the Celio Estate. The gardens, once a place of tranquil beauty, now felt like a battlefield waiting to be stormed.

Cristionna’s interrogation chamber was a study in controlled discomfort. Stone walls absorbed sound, leaving only the heavy rasp of Faldren Vayne's breathing audible. The single torch, strategically placed, cast harsh shadows that danced across his sweating face, making him appear both guilty and pathetic.

"The mercenaries, Vayne," Cristionna said, her voice low and even. It was a tone honed over years of extracting truths from the unwilling. "Let's not pretend you were simply ensuring 'fair trade practices'. Fair trade doesn't involve disrupting shipments, intimidating traders, and…" she paused, letting the word hang in the air, "...murder."

Vayne flinched. "I… I never ordered anyone to be killed. I swear it! I only wanted to… to make Celio see reason. To remind her that the merchant guilds have power."

"Power that you misused," Cristionna countered, stepping closer. The scent of sweat and desperation clung to Vayne like a shroud. "You financed those mercenaries, knowing full well the potential for violence. Don't insult my intelligence with your denials."

He wrung his hands, the silk of his tailored coat doing little to hide the tremor that ran through him. "I was desperate! My business was failing. Celio's deals with the dragons… they ruined me! Everything I worked for, gone! What was I supposed to do, just stand by and watch myself be destroyed?"

Cristionna knew that desperation could drive a man to do terrible things. But it didn't excuse them. "You chose a dangerous path, Vayne. A path that could lead to war. A war no one wants, except perhaps those who profit from chaos."

She gestured to the table beside her, where the decoded messages lay neatly arranged. "These coded parchments tell a different story, Vayne. A story of meticulously planned attacks, targeted assassinations, and the deliberate sowing of discord. Do you deny these are your instructions?"

Vayne stared at the parchment, his eyes widening. "Those… those are business correspondence! Investment proposals! Nothing more!" His voice rose in pitch, bordering on hysteria.

Cristionna picked up one of the messages, reading aloud in a clear, steady voice, " 'The shipment of firebloom is delayed due to… unfavorable weather conditions'. 'Unfavorable weather conditions', Vayne? That's your code for 'the ambush was successful, the goods destroyed'?"

He said nothing, only continued his silent internal struggling.

Cristionna pressed on, her voice a relentless hammer. "And this one… 'The nightingale sings sweetly, but its song is false'. Meaning what, Vayne? That Grimbold Stonehand successfully bribed Councilman Elmsworth?"

"I… I don't know what you're talking about!" he stammered, but the denial lacked conviction. The sweat on his brow glistened under the torchlight.

Cristionna watched him, a cold calculation in her eyes. She knew she was close. Close to breaking him completely. But something still nagged at her. Vayne was a pawn, a tool. Someone else was pulling the strings, orchestrating the conspiracy from the shadows.

*He’s too pathetic. Too easily broken.* Cristionna thought to herself, her mind racing. *Vayne had the means and the motive, but does he truly have the skill to plan such complex schemes? Or are these attacks and coded messages the work of a sharper mind?*

She picked up the fake paladin shield Bettina recovered from Grimbold's residence. *The gryphon sigil... could it be someone within the order?* The thought sent a chill down her spine. If that was true, then the rot had spread far deeper than she initially suspected.

Cristionna let the silence hang in the air, allowing Vayne's fear to fester. Finally, she spoke, her voice softer now, almost… coaxing. "Vayne, I know you're not the mastermind behind this. You're just a man who made a bad decision. But you can still redeem yourself. Tell me who else is involved. Tell me who gave you the orders."

He looked up at her, his eyes filled with a flicker of hope. "I… I can't. They'll kill me."

"They'll kill you anyway," Cristionna said, her voice hardening once more. "But if you cooperate, I can offer you protection. I can guarantee your safety. At least, for a time."

Vayne remained silent for a long moment, his mind clearly warring between fear and the slim chance of survival. *Think, Vayne, think!* he yelled inside his head. The High Council's dungeons and the assassins he employed both seemed an equally gruesome end.

Cristionna stepped back, giving him space to breathe, to think. She knew she had enough evidence to bring to Celio. Enough to expose Vayne and cripple the immediate threat. But she didn't have the full picture. Not yet. *Patience,* she told herself. *The truth will come. It always does.*

"I…" Vayne began, his voice barely a whisper. But then, the door to the chamber creaked open, and a guard stepped inside.

"My Lady Cristionna," he said, his voice low and urgent. "Lady Celio requests your presence. It is… urgent."

Alli stood before a sprawling map of the region in her war room, its surface illuminated by the flickering light of several strategically placed braziers. The room, usually a haven of strategic planning, now felt like a pressure cooker. Tawnya loomed silently at her side, a granite mountain of muscle and unwavering loyalty. Cristionna entered with her grim report. The weight of their combined burdens hung heavy in the air.

"Vayne cracked, but not completely," Cristionna reported, her face etched with frustration. "He admitted to funding rebels and sabotaging trade routes, but claims he was acting on orders from… higher up. He wouldn’t give up any names."

Alli's hand tightened into a fist. "Figures," she muttered. She turned to Tawnya. “Any new communications?"

Tawnya shook her head. "Bettina's last message finally came through, My Lady. Apparently there was some sort of communication breakdown. Messengers are claiming some interference… a static that rendered written orders illegible. Though it's hard to believe, since they claim this all started days ago…"

Alli sighed, she had already dealt with the messenger for being negligent in bringing the message, and that was a separate annoyance entirely. "Just get on with the message then."

"She says... she discovered evidence that the merchant consortiums are hiring mercenaries to disrupt our trade deals. She was on the cusp of figuring out who, when communications stopped…"

Alli swore, a Draconic curse that made Cristionna wince. "Those short-sighted, greedy fools! They can't see that this alliance is the only thing preventing another war?"

Cristionna stepped forward, placing the fake paladin shield on the table with a dull thud. "It's worse than that, Alli. Vayne’s coded messages, combined with Bettina's information… it all points to a coordinated effort, not just to undermine your authority, but to destabilize the entire alliance. They are attacking draconic shipments, sabotaging human caravans... sowing chaos to turn us against each other."

Alli’s eyes narrowed, her Draconic heritage blazing in her gaze. "They want a return to the old days, when dragons and humans were enemies, locked in an endless cycle of bloodshed." She turned towards the window. *What a naive wish for something with such brutal consequences.*

"It appears so, My Lady. The coded ledger speaks of politicians sympathetic to the anti-alliance cause, possibly being funded by the merchants. They are playing a dangerous game." Cristionna affirmed.

"A game they will lose," Alli spat. "I will not allow these… whelps to jeopardize everything we've worked for."

A tense silence settled over the war room as they all contemplated the implications. Finally, Alli spoke, her voice low and dangerous. "Tawnya, summon representatives from each of the major merchant consortiums. Tell them I require their presence here, within the hour."

Tawnya nodded, her expression grim. "And if they refuse, My Lady?"

"Then remind them of the… consequences of defying the Dragon Queen," Alli said, a cruel smile playing on her lips. "Remind them of the agreements they made, of the power I hold. Remind them what happens when fire is played with carelessly."

Cristionna hesitated. "Alli, are you sure this is wise? Confronting them directly could escalate the situation further."

"And letting them continue to plot and scheme behind my back is a better alternative?" Alli retorted, her voice laced with impatience. "No. This ends now. They will answer for their treachery."

Cristionna pressed her lips into a thin line, unconvinced. “Then I suggest, before they arrive, we examine the shield that Bettina recovered from Stonehand. There may be more secrets that the shield holds. And there is no doubt that Stonehand was in contact with someone, who made the order for the replica."

Alli frowned. "I don't see how the paladin is involved, but…" She paused, considering. "Very well. It can't hurt to be prepared for every angle."

The atmosphere in the room was now charged with anticipation. The weight of the alliance, the threat of war, and the treachery of those she had trusted pressed down on Alli, fueling her determination. This was not just about trade routes or political power. This was about the future, about the fragile peace she had worked so hard to forge. She would not let it crumble. Not now. Not ever.

The Guild Hall reeked of nervous sweat and expensive perfumes, a noxious blend that did little to soothe Alli's simmering rage. Flanked by Tawnya’s imposing figure and a detachment of Dragon Guards, she swept into the chamber, the click of her scaled boots echoing on the polished floor.

Grimbold Stonehand, his face a mask of practiced composure, stood among the assembled merchants. Faldren Vayne, always quick to posture, offered a shallow bow. The other representatives, a motley collection of faces etched with varying degrees of unease, shifted nervously in their seats.

"I trust you all understand why I've summoned you here today?" Alli began, her voice amplified by the hall’s acoustics, each word measured and sharp. "Or shall I spell it out for you?"

Grimbold stepped forward, his voice smooth as aged brandy. "Dragon Queen Celio, it's always a pleasure to host you. However, I must admit, the urgency of this gathering has left us somewhat perplexed."

"Perplexed?" Alli raised an eyebrow, a dangerous glint in her eyes. "Let's dispense with the pleasantries, Grimbold. I'm here because I know what you've been doing."

She gestured towards Tawnya, who stepped forward and placed a stack of parchment – copies of the coded messages – on the large mahogany table that dominated the room. “These were found in the possession of known associates. Perhaps you can enlighten me on their meaning?"

Vayne scoffed, stepping forward. "Insinuations and whispers, hardly concrete evidence. If we are to be dragged in here with such little to show for the inconvenience it is an insult.”

"Indeed," Grimbold added. "It’s unfortunate that some may make connections with so little substance."

Alli leaned forward, placing her hands on the table. "Are you denying that these messages exist?"

"We deny any knowledge of such nefarious dealings,” said one merchant, the stout man sweating as he spoke. "There's no indication where such correspondence originated."

"No indication? Perhaps this will jog your memories then.” She beckoned Tawnya forward again, who this time brought forth Grimbold’s ledger and the replica paladin shield Bettina had secured.

Alli watched as recognition flashed in Grimbold's eyes, quickly masked by practiced indifference. Vayne, however, paled slightly. *He knows. And he's worried.*

"This ledger," Alli continued, tapping the leather-bound volume. "Details a series of… irregular transactions. Transactions that seem to coincide with disruptions in our trade agreements, sabotaged shipments, and escalating tensions between our nations. Coincidence? I think not."

Grimbold cleared his throat. "My Lady, I assure you, any discrepancies in my accounts are merely clerical errors. Nothing more."

"Clerical errors that involve funding mercenary groups to attack draconic caravans?" Alli challenged, her voice rising. "Clerical errors that involve siphoning resources to support anti-alliance factions?"

The merchants exchanged uneasy glances, their unity beginning to crack under the weight of Alli's accusations. A murmur rippled through the room.

Alli could feel their fear, their desperation. It was almost intoxicating. She pushed further. “And what about this lovely little shield? A forgery, I understand, with… curious secrets hidden within.”

Vayne stepped forward again. "My Lady, are you suggesting we are funding a rebellion? That we wish to reignite the Dragon Wars? We, more than anyone, would be devastated to see it occur.”

Alli fixed him with a cold stare. “Then tell me, Faldren, if you are so innocent, why is it that coded messages containing plans to undermine me, my authority, and this alliance keep finding their way back to you?”

Vayne attempted a smile, but it faltered. "Perhaps... perhaps someone is trying to frame us. Someone who wishes to destabilize the region and profit from the chaos."

*A convenient excuse,* Alli thought. But also, not entirely untrue. She knew Bettina was playing her own game, manipulating events for her own gain. *A dangerous game she should avoid meddling in, lest she burn too bright.*

Alli slammed her fist on the table, the force of the blow making the merchants jump. "Enough! I've heard enough of your lies and your deflections. I know what you've done. And I will not tolerate it."

She paused, letting her words sink in. The air in the Guild Hall was thick with tension, heavy with unspoken threats.

"From this moment forward," Alli declared, her voice ringing with Draconic authority, "I am placing all merchant consortiums under strict surveillance. Any further attempts to undermine this alliance, any further acts of sabotage or treachery, will be met with swift and decisive action. You will find yourselves facing the full might of the Draconic Council. Am I understood?"

Silence.

Alli surveyed the room, her gaze sweeping over the faces of the merchants. Fear. Disbelief. Resentment. But also, a grudging acceptance. They knew she meant business.

Finally, Grimbold Stonehand spoke, his voice subdued. "Understood, My Lady."

The rest followed suit, their voices a chorus of forced acquiescence. "Understood, My Lady."

Alli nodded, a cruel smile playing on her lips. "Good. Then we are done here."

She turned on her heel, Tawnya and the Dragon Guards falling into step behind her. As she strode out of the Guild Hall, she could feel the weight of their gazes on her back. Enemies, every last one of them. But for now, they were contained. For now, she had bought herself some time. And in this volatile landscape, time was the most precious commodity of all.

Alli Celio halted at the threshold, pivoting back to face the assembled merchants. "One last thing," she said, her voice now a low growl that seemed to vibrate in the very stones of the hall. "The rogue attacks. They cease. Immediately. All intercepted shipments will be released unharmed. Furthermore..." She paused, letting the suspense build, the unspoken demand hanging in the air. "Grimbold Stonehand, Faldren Vayne, you will both publicly confess to your actions. Acknowledge your attempt to destabilize the alliance, and offer recompense for the damages you caused."

The blood drained from Faldren’s face. Grimbold stood stock-still, his knuckles white where he gripped the edge of the table.

"Confess?" Vayne stammered. "But... that's... that's impossible. We would be ruined!"

"You already *are* ruined," Alli said, her eyes blazing. "I have the evidence. The coded messages, the ledgers, the flow of funds – all pointing directly to your conspiracy. The only question now is whether you will face ruin with a shred of dignity, or dragged kicking and screaming into the abyss."

She tapped a finger against the hilt of her sword, the polished steel glinting in the light. “Consider the alternative: should I release the evidence I do have against you now, that ‘medium-sized army’ Martie reported that I have wouldn’t need to make a single move against your consortiums. The damage alone will crumble you like cheap kindling.”

*Martie.* The name sent a flicker of cold fury through Alli. Bettina had been right about her, of course. The little weasel had played both sides. *But she will be dealt with later.*

A deathly silence filled the hall. The merchants shifted uncomfortably, their eyes darting between Alli and the two men she had accused. They could smell blood in the water, sensed the shift in power. Grimbold and Faldren were on their own.

Stonehand was the first to break. He sank to his knees, his massive frame collapsing like a deflated wineskin. "My Lady," he croaked, his voice barely a whisper. "Forgive me. I was... misguided. I was manipulated. I admit to everything."

A collective gasp swept through the room.

Faldren, however, remained defiant. He glared at Grimbold, his face contorted with rage. "You fool! You weakling! Don't you see what she's doing? She's trying to divide us!"

"It appears she is doing a quite good job," Stonehand replied back weakly from his kneeling position.

Alli just smirked. "No division is needed; for the only thing I've divided is the truth for which you were all too scared to look for yourselves. Grimbold here had a chance at redemption; what do you say, Faldren, have you had your fill of shadows?."

"Enough!" Alli thundered, her Draconic voice echoing off the vaulted ceiling. A tremor ran through the floor, sending a few nearby objects tumbling from tables. "I am losing patience. Vayne. Choose. Confession, or consequences."

The other merchants began to pressure him as well. He'd lost them their standings with the Draconic nation for profit and their collective silence to maintain solidarity as a defense of their actions, and he has let them all down.

Realizing he had no allies left, Faldren finally cracked. He dropped to his knees beside Grimbold, his head bowed in defeat. "I confess," he muttered, the words tasting like ash in his mouth. "I... I was involved. In the attacks, in the funding... I did it all."

Alli surveyed the scene, her expression unreadable. The two most powerful merchants in Porthaven, groveling at her feet. A testament to her power, to her authority.

“Good,” she said, her voice devoid of warmth. “Now, as for the consequences…” She paused, a predatory glint in her eyes. “Those will be discussed at a later time. Be assured, however, they will be substantial. You will both be paying back any damage you two have made tenfold for any and all who suffered under your decisions. Failure to comply will result in immediate confiscation of your property and wealth.”

She turned again, striding towards the exit. This time, no one dared to interrupt her. As she left the Guild Hall, she allowed a small, satisfied smile to grace her lips. The immediate threat had been quelled. But the war, she knew, was far from over. She still needed to extract the truth from Martie and figure out why she betrayed her in the first place. *A dragon never forgets such transgression.*

She also knew that Bettina was in Porthaven somewhere, chasing after whatever shadows she had concocted. This also left Alli with a sinking realization.

*Is she really worth all of this?*

The thought gnawed at her as she made her way back to the Grey Scales offices. She had brought stability here, even if just for a bit; and as she continued onwards, the only answer she could arrive at was one filled with grim intent.

Bettina's schemes had to be stopped, even if it meant making her a tool for it.

Alli found Tawnya waiting for her in the hallway, her massive frame a stark contrast to the ornate, almost frivolous décor of the Merchant Guild Hall. Tawnya’s brow was furrowed with concern.

"Are you alright, My Lady?" she asked, her voice a low rumble. "That was... intense."

"Intense, but necessary," Alli replied, massaging her temples. "They needed to understand the consequences of their actions. And, more importantly, the strength of our alliance."

Tawnya nodded, but her expression remained troubled. "They understand the consequences *now*, My Lady. But what about tomorrow? What about next week? Faldren and Grimbold may be humbled, but their resentment will fester. Others will see an opportunity."

Alli sighed. Tawnya was right, of course. This fragile peace was built on fear and intimidation, not genuine loyalty. She'd quelled the immediate rebellion, but the seeds of discontent remained.

“I am aware, Tawnya,” Alli said, deciding to confide a portion of her worries, “this is a precarious peace. Which is why I need the Underworld insight regarding these dealings... has anything come up?"

"Nothing concrete, My Lady. The whispers say they're licking their wounds for the moment, reassessing their strategy. Some talk of going underground, diverting funds through less… conspicuous channels. Others… well, some are already whispering about finding new leadership."

“New leadership…” Alli mused. That was a dangerous prospect. It meant someone, somewhere, was already vying for control, eager to exploit the current instability. She thought back to Bettina, and her original intentions to leverage her for more stability in the Porthaven region. 

"Keep your ear to the ground, Tawnya. I want to know everything. Every whisper, every rumor, every clandestine meeting. And let's make sure those Merchant brats have some 'accidents' as we let go of the city watch contracts in this city.”

Tawnya nodded grimly. "Consider it done, My Lady. But what about… other matters?"

Alli knew exactly what she meant. Bettina, Martie, and the tangled web of secrets and betrayals she found herself ensnared in. She debated how much to reveal to Tawnya. The goliath was fiercely loyal, but her directness sometimes lacked the necessary subtlety.

"Those are… being handled," Alli said carefully. "I have a… plan. It involves a certain information broker currently residing in Porthaven. A plan that can only function properly if they are unaware they're being lead to slaughter."

Tawnya frowned. "Are you sure this is wise, My Lady? Using… a pawn? They are a danger, not a tool."

"Perhaps. But every tool has its purpose, Tawnya. And sometimes, the most dangerous tools are the most effective." She paused, her gaze hardening. "Just make sure this tool doesn’t make any wrong turns on its assignment... and don't be so easily tricked by others."

They walked in silence for a moment, the weight of their conversation hanging heavy in the air. As they reached the Grey Scales offices, Alli paused, turning to face her bodyguard.

"One more thing, Tawnya. I need you to discreetly increase surveillance on Martie’s shop. I have a feeling she knows more than she's letting on." And, perhaps, she needed to see what Martie did with those daggers after she came to her, who she made contact with, and just how deep the rabbit hole could possibly go with that small forger.

"Understood, My Lady," Tawnya replied, her eyes narrowing. "She will not be escaping your grasp. If there is one thing I can assure you, its that I can get more out of her than what that 'information broker' can."

Alli nodded, a flicker of something unreadable in her eyes. "See to it."

She entered her office, the familiar scent of old parchment and ink offering a small measure of comfort. She sank into her chair, the weight of the world pressing down on her shoulders.

*This is far from over.*

The fragile peace she had forged in Porthaven was built on shaky ground. Resentment simmered beneath the surface, and the threat of betrayal loomed large. She knew she couldn’t trust anyone, not even those closest to her. The only person who really got what needed to be done to succeed was herself, and she had to continue to put that trust in herself.

She rubbed her temples, trying to clear her mind. She had to focus on the task at hand, to anticipate her enemies' moves, to be one step ahead. She also had to think about Martie and what would be done to her for treason. She glanced at a stack of reports on her desk, detailing trade routes, financial transactions, and potential threats. Each document was a piece of the puzzle, a clue in a game she couldn’t afford to lose. If she failed, all that she would be able to bring to the Draconic Alliance with humanity will be laid to ruin. She had to ensure that this would not occur by any means possible.

The weight of her responsibilities settled heavily upon her. She was the linchpin holding this delicate balance together, the shield against the storm. And she would bear that burden, no matter the cost. She glanced out the window, the city lights twinkling below like fallen stars. A fragile peace indeed. She couldn't rest yet, for the scales of fate were still teetering in a deadly balance. The war, like the Draconic flame in her chest, was far from over. She was just beginning.
